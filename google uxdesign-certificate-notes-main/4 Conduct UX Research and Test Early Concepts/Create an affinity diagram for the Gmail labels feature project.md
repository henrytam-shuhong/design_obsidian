You’ve already learned that affinity diagramming is a quick and easy way to gather observations during a usability study and synthesize data.

If you need an in-depth review of affinity diagramming, revisit the reading [_Learn more about affinity diagrams_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/5FfQh/learn-more-about-creating-affinity-diagrams)

_._

Now, you’ll review a completed example of an affinity diagram made for the Gmail labels feature project. You'll see how valuable this technique is for a UX designer to quickly organize information and identify themes from the user feedback. You can use this example as a guide when you do your own affinity diagramming for your own projects. 

## **Choose a sticky note tool**

Affinity diagrams are usually created by putting sticky notes on a whiteboard, window, or another blank surface. Thankfully, there are many digital options to build your affinity diagram as well. Some options for creating a digital affinity map include: 

- [Jamboard](http://jamboard.google.com)
    

- [Miro](https://miro.com/)
    

- [Mural](https://www.mural.co/)
    

- [FigJam](https://www.figma.com/figjam/)
    

All of these offer similar functionality—try one or more out to know which you prefer. 

In the following example, a designer created digital sticky notes to create their affinity diagram. However, keep in mind that physical sticky notes can be used as well. All you would need to do is simply fill out individual sticky notes; stick them onto a wall, window, or whiteboard; and find groups or themes using the methods outlined below. 

## **Add concise notes**

Pulling from the note-taking spreadsheet template found in the lesson [_Take notes during a mock usability study for the Gmail labels feature_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/supplement/PT6RI/activity-take-notes-during-a-usability-study)

_,_ the designer who built the following affinity diagram began by transferring the notes from the spreadsheet to the digital sticky notes. Each observation and participant quote was put onto its own sticky note.

It helps to be clear and concise with the sticky notes. This constraint helps articulate the point clearly and in fewer words, making it easier to understand and articulate insights. Once the designer had every observation and quote from the study written on a sticky note, they were ready to diagram.

The designer could assign each participant their own sticky note color as well. That would make it easier to identify when multiple people express the same or similar things—helping highlight trends more clearly. Numbering can accomplish the same thing.

## **Sort by similarity**

With all the notes on the affinity diagram board, the designer’s next step was to move them around. There is no specific method to follow in this process, but at its most basic level, the designer is  searching for and grouping the sticky notes by similarities. 

For example, if there are several notes about things that **frustrated** the participants, those can be placed next to each other. Going deeper, if a number of those notes are about frustrations with **navigation,** those can be placed in a separate or sub group.  

In this Gmail label project diagram, the designer gathered similar issues into a grouping called “Confusion.”  The designer discovered that all the following sticky notes related to users being confused about different things—such as, finding the three-dot menu, changing the color of the “Shopping” label and understanding the use of the word “nest” when adding a sublabel.

![An image of ten digital sticky notes the designer organized into a group labeled “Confusion.”](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/3eyuNsg3SBGMdITbSLhE3Q_1b2d8898a21046bbb23cb60337651cf1_ueJ6qAj2uoPUcanPt7nhm5xkphyolrzVSppgVyOAsr5-G-Ku2X2dmxKBnFrpmHND7JzNd_zgDU82cFPOYbfXEzwwDWjBqDDefRAGJpb91Sfmm3ZLiV7vHT7tAvXrhwSwhowLHE43JI-P5wo7QaIhAp3rCU5EDT3l-pvJ7nsMYfSDWIXJhlllB107ZgtBkqlM24zvlrReXzwasl9Y6qg0fL6j19oJdnmEEp6-wQ?expiry=1745020800000&hmac=n_xskTCYm9hF08sm_UmrggDBZp2W64qWl-_BfhAGiOE)

The different colors and letters represent feedback from five different users. The feedback gathered informed the designer in the following ways: Four users (green, orange, yellow, blue) had trouble finding the three dots for the sub-menu; three users (green, orange, yellow) had trouble changing the color of the “Shopping” label; three users were confused by the word “nest” when adding a sublabel (yellow, orange, pink)

Note that not everything will fit cleanly into groups. The outliers are still valuable pieces of information, but they may not be part of a theme.

## **Identify themes**

After sorting and grouping all the notes, the designer ended up with four groupings and determined the larger themes of the groups: Useful, Getting Started, Tone, and Confusion. The theme names can be anything that sums up the experience of multiple users under one common category.

In order to maximize an affinity diagram, it’s a good idea to take a break after the first round of organization to determine if there are other ways to organize your notes. There is no single "correct" way to organize the findings. By taking another pass, additional or more nuanced themes may be uncovered. 

## **Key takeaways** 

Use affinity diagrams to gather observations during a usability study and synthesize data quickly and easily. Whether digital or physical, your affinity diagram should:

- Include all of your notes from testing
    
- Be sorted into clusters and subsets to highlight themes
    

Keep in mind, this example is just one way to complete this activity. Your version may have the sticky notes in different groups, or grouped in different themes. What's important is that the themes you discovered work for your specific feedback and project.
