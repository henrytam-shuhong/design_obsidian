Presentations are a great way to share your research insights with people in your organization and external parties. There are many digital tools you can use to create a presentation, like Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Apple Keynote. But regardless of the tool you use, how can you make sure that your presentations are strong enough to hold your audience’s attention and get your point across? In this reading, you’ll learn some tips for creating UX research presentations that keep your audience engaged from the first slide to the last.

## **Tip 1: Know your audience**

Before the presentation begins, take time to find out what your audience is interested in learning about, then tailor your presentation accordingly. For example, a presentation to a marketing team will probably be different than a presentation to management, so you'll need to be adaptable. A personalized approach keeps your audience engaged during your presentation and increases your ability to gain their support for your project.

## **Tip 2: Provide an overview**

Include a short roadmap or table of contents at the beginning of your presentation, so your audience knows what to expect throughout the presentation. Your roadmap should almost be like a checklist that the audience can follow along, so they have a vision for how much content is left to cover.

In addition, one slide should feature an overview of the content you’re presenting, also known as an executive summary. It’s like sharing your conclusion or biggest takeaways at the beginning of the presentation. Be sure to discuss how your research impacts the big picture, like how the product would support the company’s goals and objectives. When your audience understands the overall goal of the presentation and your product from the start, they’ll have a better context for specific details and stories you provide later.

## **Tip 3: Tell a story**

Think of your presentation as a story with a beginning, middle, and end. Each slide should push the story you’re telling forward, and the story should flow from slide to slide. Part of telling an effective and engaging story is including examples of actual users, such as quotes, photos, or short video clips from interactions with users. Storytelling is more powerful than sharing a list of research insights because your audience can observe the emotions, pain points, and delights of your product from a real user’s point of view.

## **Tip 4: Show data**

Data often communicates more clearly than words. Use graphs and charts to illustrate your most important insights. Your goal is to keep the attention of your audience, so let the images and data you show speak to your audience and strengthen the story you’re telling.

## **Tip 5: Less is more when it comes to text**

![Illustration showing a female presenter talking to a diverse audience and displaying a slide with minimal text.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/QyWK2cBARUuQPVrPdC3dLg_e11aa4c72e6941e8b52f4e75f88cd0f1_OKN3RiTH1h41d1oK4dO426o3n-l667z0c6d36HLNYoq3Nc5qf8gG8nHrNSb9-KdE5Xfck9JDLvlNLhQIJWavzDFZqcG64Owe8qBxdDq6VMaSyHb-lo5vF7-2z24CVb3Zu6KnpiAHgWN2c51dQw4XFlU?expiry=1745020800000&hmac=QWXEJIk_CKft2dOtayuipSrUJGNibKPbDy3LAxXZGro)

Keep the information you present short and to the point. Your slides should only include high-level details that answer questions like why, what, and how. Try to include minimal text on your slides so that the audience doesn't spend time reading while you're presenting. If necessary, you can add additional resources in the appendix of your presentation for the audience to review later.

## **Tip 6: Provide recommendations for next steps**

![Illustration showing a female presenter talking to a diverse audience and displaying a slide listing recommendations.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/JrX4zvDCTf-qVUPud_Z9DQ_54dfc8e8e5ab4a7aa9b718452ef56ef1_hpK0ZDsRLaVzbi3A3dIYOj7wvH41QqBBC7a2MLubu6goi7HpMsnxMzZoC8mnXHYnMZw1ZRFRIJOdr7r-eKqtGunWPfBxQvlpbN8PCsTC0zemHp2l6Q406VJGc7nT1uuLdsIfX-A8WgDlfgQz3wvHsRE?expiry=1745020800000&hmac=PC6WYGp1oKXzMa1XGgYIDdt5zkNhVn4khSW6XLtIHIo)

End the presentation with a list of recommended next steps based on the insights you presented. Your recommendations might include changes to make to the product designs, additional research to conduct, or future meetings to schedule. This step helps gain support from stakeholders and will put the pieces in place to move forward in the design process. It's a best practice to clearly state your recommendations on a single slide.

## **Tip 7: Leave time for questions**

![Illustration showing a female presenter talking to a diverse audience and displaying a slide asking if there are questions.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/j0KbznpXTUqRCe0rPZyMHg_bba2a58988364ee4ae9b8bab4751bdf1_C1xoeA6Ya_myW9DmBhrV-hhbwROIyXfgfbF6y2Gh450GdqpRWu7yJw6MU71U6Q9RWXymeYEiAhIMTIK11Uj_ZuF8j7W2IXBY16RVGIFLR37lOdBNqwQ7Fn3FsNrptd8dio1Mx1D4hJJz74AUaEx6EKA?expiry=1745020800000&hmac=renkwCqH8w9oczeS7ReV_HjfHl7MLyPjIJtbWfd-EXc)

At the end of your presentation, be sure to leave some time for your audience to ask questions about the material you presented and so that you can clarify any points. This is also a great opportunity for you to provide more details about areas that your audience is interested in learning more about.

And that's it! With these tips in mind, you're ready to create your very own research presentation and deliver it to stakeholders. Remember, sharing your research is an important step in the design process. Be creative and foster an environment in which people feel comfortable commenting and giving feedback.
