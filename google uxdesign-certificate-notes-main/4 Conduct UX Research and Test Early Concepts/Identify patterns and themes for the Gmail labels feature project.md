You've learned how to gather all of the data from your research into one place and organize that data so it's easy to understand. 

Now, you’ll review a completed example where a designer took observations and trends from the research about the Gmail labels feature and turned them into a list of patterns and themes. You’ll see how they analyzed the data to create simple and easy-to-understand themes. These themes will ultimately aid in improving the product design based on user feedback. 

When you’re ready to identify patterns and themes for your own projects, you can use this review as a guide to ensure you’re designing a product that meets user needs and expectations.

## **Access the template**

The designer started by using the [pattern identification template](https://docs.google.com/document/u/3/d/11XK05xs8H6z96-dKHGbxFrly1wozaRZWbRu_8niU6qk/template/preview)

to help organize the themes and patterns they uncovered.

If you don’t have a Google account, you can download the template directly from the attachment below.

## **Identify the themes**

At this point, the designer had already identified several themes by creating an affinity diagram. If you want to review the affinity diagramming example, revisit [Create an affinity diagram for your Gmail labels feature project](https://www.coursera.org/learn/conduct-ux-research/quiz/LHPjz/activity-create-an-affinity-diagram)

. Next, the designer considered the two key questions:

- What common patterns stand out in the data I collected? 
    
- What do they tell me about my product design?
    

For example, when further reviewing the **Confusion** theme identified during affinity diagramming, they noticed a pattern that four out of five participants have difficulty finding the three dots for the sub-menu.

(green, orange, yellow, blue) have “trouble finding the three dots for the sub-menu“.

## **Move themes from the affinity map to the pattern identification template**

The designer then took the identified theme from the affinity map and used the pattern identification template to create the following statement:

1. It was observed that 4 out of 5 subjects had trouble finding the three-dot sub-menu. This means that the three-dot sub-menu is difficult to find for almost all users.
    

When the designer finished pulling all the identified patterns from the affinity map, all major themes were listed in the template. This was a quick and easy process because the data was organized from the outset. 

Let’s review all the patterns the designer identified after completing in the template: 

1. It was observed that 4 out of 5 subjects had trouble finding the three-dot sub-menu. This means that the three-dot sub-menu is difficult to find for almost all users.
    
2. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects had a hard time knowing what to do first to create a label. This means that for most users, it's not immediately clear how to create a new label.
    
3. It was observed that 2 out of 5 subjects saw a use for labels. This means that labels are useful for a few people, but not an overwhelming majority.
    
4. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects were confused by the word “nest” when adding a sublabel. This means that not everyone is familiar with the term nesting or this specific use.
    
5. It was observed that 3 out of 5 subjects had trouble changing the color of the “Shopping” label. This means that most users were unsure how to change the color of a label.
    

Note that the themes that were identified based on patterns aren't complex. Instead, they are the original ideas that were expressed by participants and are now grouped together by similarities. 

The themes distilled from your research don’t need to be jargon-heavy or academic. These three suggestions will keep themes grounded in the data and accessible to those reading them:

- Keep themes simple, direct, and easy to understand. 
    
- Limit themes to just one idea or trend. 
    
- Remove opinions from the process and ensure that themes are based on objective observations. 
    

## **Key takeaways**

When you’re ready to identify patterns and themes in your projects, you can use the example in this review as a guide. The following questions will help you as you work to identify patterns:

- When reviewing the data you’ve collected, what common patterns stand out to you?
    
- Thinking about the patterns found, what do they tell you about your product design? 
    
- Formulate a statement using the Pattern Identification Template.
    
- Keep themes simple, direct, and easy to understand.
    
- Limit themes to just one idea or trend.
    
- Remove opinions from the process and ensure that themes are based on objective observations.
