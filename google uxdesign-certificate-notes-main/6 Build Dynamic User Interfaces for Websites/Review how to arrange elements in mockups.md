You’ll need to think through more than just typography, color, and iconography to create successful designs. 

You also need to consider **layouts**, which are ways to arrange elements on a page. The goal of layouts is to present information in a logical way, making the important elements stand out. You learned about common website layouts earlier in this course, including single and multicolumn layouts, the grid of cards layout, featured image layout, and more.

To create layouts that are logical and usable, use grids, containment, and negative space.

## **Grids**

Grids are lines that are evenly spaced to help you design consistently and manage the spacing of elements. Here are examples of two kinds of grids. On the left is a layout grid of vertical columns and alleys. On the right is a basic grid of intersecting vertical and horizontal lines. (Remember that Figma calls basic grids “Uniform Grids.”)

You learned about using grids in Figma earlier. If you need a refresher, check out this reading from a previous course of the certificate about [creating grids in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/U8TTJ/create-grids-in-your-mockups)

.

## **Containment**

As you create mockups, it’s also important to think about the way the elements are contained. Containment uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. As a reminder, there are four methods of containment:

### **Dividers**

Dividers use single lines to separate sections of a page. In this example of an inbox, there are dividers separating each message within the inbox.

### Borders

Borders use continuous lines that often form shapes, like squares or rectangles, to break up sections of a page. In this example, there are clear pink borders around the sizes for this blouse and a black border around the size that has been selected.

### Fill

Fill is a method of containment that assigns colors to borders and shapes. On this app, you can see a button at the bottom with an icon in the middle. Behind that icon is a filled, yellow circle.

### Shadows 

Shadows create dimension in combination with borders or fill. On this app, when a movie is selected, a shadow appears below it to better telegraph the movement of the section. Below, you will also see an image that shows how the depth of a shadow can change the perspective of the element.

## **Negative space**

Finally, as you determine how to arrange elements in your mockups, you will need to consider the use of negative space. Negative space is the area that surrounds an object within an image. Put another way, it’s the gaps between the elements in the design or the space that’s not being used. 

Negative space helps users read content and identify important information. For example, compare the negative space in the two high-fidelity mockups below. On the left, the visual and textual elements are more crowded, which makes them harder to view and read. On the right, there’s more negative space, which makes the content easier to engage with and more visually appealing.
