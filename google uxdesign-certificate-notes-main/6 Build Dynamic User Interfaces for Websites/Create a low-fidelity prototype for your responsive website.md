This review provides an example of how to use a **low-fidelity prototype** to demonstrate the functionality of a responsive website. Specifically, you’ll see how a designer created a user flow and prototype for the checkout process of the online shopping store Tee’s Shirts.

If you’re taking this Certificate in order, you’ve already learned how to create a lo-fi prototype in an earlier course. If you need a refresher, you can review [Learn more about lo-fi prototyping in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wireframes-low-fidelity-prototypes/supplement/r9sJl/learn-more-about-lo-fi-prototyping-in-figma)

## **Create a user flow**

![Image of multiple desktop wireframes including a home page, a menu, and a t-shirt product page.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/CNBzc4QZRUaMGL7uHErKug_e6f633dbcb6b4f51b7bed2da95dba5f1_bbj3pIPVBsRG4Qgy0Vkhg722n2Nk7oFJixjfbk7-Ybqet918xCHJQ5UUw1eWNXtnuUarah3S71fmM7-8JcAPLL13k8ho3awgdHYHX7P10lQam4-IQ_1Yf9PlJg-UD8S0RzuumFLp_wwV_7q16IAUortKTGSEBMKcPiENGUB6bcou0wMiMik6YKuGX1vOnsKn4GUpN8-9lM20GiDYrzUvlCmI1Nw4a0Gq-pRJ9Q?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=txrOcYf-0BEkEHueEaHEG5wsxx1Inv6OkEuQalrOobY)

The designer started by thinking about the task they wanted users to complete, and asked themselves two questions:

1. How will users navigate through the necessary pages on the website? 
    
2. How will users go from one page to the next?
    

To address these questions, the designer started by building a user flow that allowed users to: 

- Move forwards and backwards
    
- Enter the flow from different starting points
    
- Clearly understand when the desired user flow has ended
    
- Return to the entry point after completing the simulated interaction
    

### **Open the project and select prototype mode**

To accomplish their goal, the designer opened their digital wireframe project in Figma, went to the right sidebar, and clicked the **Prototype** tab to start creating the user interaction flow between the pages.

### **Decide the user entry points**

The designer studied the wireframes to decide on the main user flow. Here are some questions they took into consideration when deciding on the main entry point:

- What do I want my user to be able to do? 
    
- How will my users navigate through the website structure?
    
- Where do I want them to start their journey?
    

In this example from the Tee’s Shirts website, the designer wanted the user to be able to select an item and go through the checkout process; they called this a “checkout flow.”

In this example, the designer sketched an ideal user flow for purchasing an item: 

1. Navigate to the women’s section.
    
2. Choose a t-shirt.
    
3. Select the color and size.
    
4. Add it to the cart.
    
5. Continue to checkout.
    
6. Fill in e-mail address information.
    
7. Choose a shipping option.
    
8. Enter payment and billing information.
    
9. Click “Place order.”
    

### **Connect frames using prototype mode**

The designer then connected the items in the frames to allow users to click through the pages of the website to complete the “checkout flow.” To do this, they used the following steps:

1. Click the **Prototype** tab on the right sidebar. 
    
2. Click the first item in the user flow. Once complete, a blue circular node on the right side of the item will appear.
    
3. Click and drag the blue arrow to the destination item on the other frame.
    
4. Release the mouse and notice that the blue arrow has been drawn connecting the two items. 
    

![Image of two wireframes connected by a blue line. On the left of the line is a blue plus sign where the connection starts,](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/C_X9bKP_QiyfJKM_WQCeiA_4ec21648237b40e2a7eaac3493f8c8f1_rISwqG09NaWI4GZPND4Xx_aTvJ5h8NCUPOnQmERmNZc49Qizqwfq5sdZeRM0e2RC3HxS2OUf5b38nBDsQxvDIbAdU2QZTtPxJGKl2N7WBGKQFdzvYp6hITA3wJYHELRPw0aj9_wJU8uMIYgc7PtS-How5WQIYgqQIlVGCY0qjS1jR0uir9xGNeu7ngnNQXaVGwhZ7sHvpIJehfQsOeb2U2nXvFPVJTwNUh_OUw?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=YRafV7LHwAjka8hZGrfbxvbc6tDcy4oZsqp6H0KWFI0)

and on the right side a blue arrow indicates the end of the connection point.

Here’s the finished user flow. The entry point in the prototype is the homepage:

![Image is of desktop wireframes of a user flow for Tee’s Shirt website. The flow starts on the left at the home page,](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/8IDYsvLRRmurZCZZpjL0bQ_2ef7ee5178284321bd161bf864019ef1_sFxGFmXic2HfT_cY1GLIZePgkSHIOCJgb0tQ-ICfNDHmCmMaxiCJDtygmL1o18AQbXVBuPaqfmBgcw6A2tX_t1CNveSFMJ1vDCOZE4f1cS9HWZNGyNN9e-losoCSDDIFBxROi5mkIiO6sRMHJvpzAaTVa3gdLZkfxgHKlrPosEMAny6egRbP54o3bTFItoAVSDGr8ZMMSOOJV1MxLntXKBygQNraRFC6Hn9x1Q?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=UO7r0BKniaCPe71tAu708Dtk5GGrQOCMKie1nebGAWk)

then moves to the Women’s clothing menu page, then moves to the t-shirt product page displaying t-shirts.

## **Repeat the process to complete the user flow**

Working carefully and using the intended user flow as a guide, the designer created the other interactions by following the same instructions and made sure each connection worked by previewing their prototype.

To preview a prototype, click the **Play** icon at the top right of the screen. After the preview window appears, test out the user flow by clicking on all the buttons that were connected earlier. If the user flow isn’t correct, go back and fix the interactions. For a finished prototype, connect all the wireframes necessary to complete the main user flow. This will allow users to test the entire prototype.

## **Create a checklist for the interactions**

Prototypes are designed to test how well users can complete specific tasks in a simulated activity, so it’s important to be specific about which types of interactions to build into the prototype. 

In this example, there are four interactions to notice:

- Move forward and backward.
    
- Enter the flow from the starting point.
    
- Clearly understand when the desired user flow has ended.
    
- Return to the entry point after completing the simulated interaction.
    

## **Check the prototype**

Once all the connections had been made, the designer went through the entire experience to double-check everything before finalizing the prototype and showing it to their users. 

## **Key takeaways**

When you create your own low-fidelity prototype, you can use this as a guide and compare your low-fidelity prototype to the matching example above.

As you compare, ask yourself:

- Did I remember to design in **prototype mode**?
    
- Did I draw out my user flow? How many did I do?
    
- Which entry point did I choose? Does the entry point match the example? Why do I think they are different or the same?
    
- Which interactions did I consider for the prototype? Do they match the example? Why or why not?
    
- Did I use wires to connect the start and destination items for each interaction?
    
- Did I create multiple interactions for the user in the flow of the prototype?
    
- Did I include at least four connected wireframes in a simulated navigational flow?
    
- Is there a way for users to proceed forward and backward within the flow?
    
- Is there a way provided for users to enter the flow from different starting points?
    
- Are the cues for navigation clearly indicated?
    
- Is the successful completion of the simulated activity clearly indicated?
    
- Are users returned to an origin point after successfully completing the simulated activity?

# Exemplars: Create a low-fidelity prototype for your responsive website

In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of low-fidelity prototypes for  responsive websites based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate program: 

- Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.
    
- Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.
    
- Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor its inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.
    

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in [Create a low-fidelity prototype for your responsive website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/supplement/wVw0P/review-create-a-low-fidelity-prototype-for-your-responsive-website)

. You can compare your own work to these examples, which meet all the criteria required for a low-fidelity prototype. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for a low-fidelity prototype for a responsive website.

.

In this low-fidelity prototype exemplar, the user can search for available pavilions that fit their needs for an event, and they can then reserve and book the pavilion online from anywhere, at any time. Users can complete a task or user flow, move forward and backward, and navigate with the cues included. In this example, this prototype is testing the main user flow of searching for an available pavilion to rent, selecting an option that works best for the user's needs, selecting an available date to book, and completing the reservation by paying the rental fee.

## Go>>Fresh

.

In this low-fidelity prototype exemplar, the user can access their inventory to track sales and available stock, review statistics relating to spending and sales, and reach out to suppliers for orders. Users can also add items or view item details. Users can complete a task or user flow, move forward and backward, and navigate with the cues included. Remember that a prototype is always built around testing the user flow that solves the user problem. In this example, this prototype is testing the main user flow of monitoring and managing inventory.

## Key takeaways

All of the example prototypes presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. You can compare your low-fidelity prototypes to these exemplars whenever you’re ready. As you compare, ask yourself:

Does your prototype:

- Connect at least four distinct wireframes, allowing the completion of a main user flow?
    
- Include connections that allow users to proceed forward and backward within the sequence?
    
- Include clear navigation cues?
    
- Display messaging or navigational cues that indicate the successful completion of the simulated user flow?
    
- Include a means for users to return to the starting point after successfully completing the flow sequence?
    

If any of your answers are no, return to [Create a low-fidelity prototype for your responsive website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/supplement/wVw0P/review-create-a-low-fidelity-prototype-for-your-responsive-website)

and make adjustments to your prototypes. You can use the three exemplars provided in this reading as a reference when creating your own prototypes.
