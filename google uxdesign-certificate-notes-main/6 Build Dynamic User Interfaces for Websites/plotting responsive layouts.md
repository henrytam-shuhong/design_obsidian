The responsive website designs you create in this course and in the real world must adjust to fit the platform or device being used.

Try this quick activity: On your computer, open two of your favorite or most visited websites. Remember the common website layouts that you learned about earlier in the course, like grid of cards, feature image, and multicolumn? What type of layouts do your chosen websites have?

Then, open the same websites on a mobile phone or tablet. Does the website have a different layout on this smaller screen size than it did on your computer? Notice how different elements and components are organized for each screen’s dimensions.

As a reminder, **responsive web design** means creating changes to the appearance, or layout, of a website, depending on the device being used to view it and the size of the screen. In the image above, the website uses a multicolumn layout on a laptop screen size, and a single column layout on a mobile phone screen size.

Responsive design is an integral part of good UX, as it increases your product’s usability. Have you ever used a website where you couldn’t see a button or a graphic went off the side of the screen, like in the image below? Designing with responsive layouts will prevent these kinds of usability issues from happening in your projects.

The good news is that when you design with responsive layouts, you don’t have to create a different design for every potential device and every different screen size. Instead, you design for a few key sizes in a framework that allows content to adjust to the screen size.

Behind the code of the website are parameters called breakpoints. **Breakpoints** are the visual limits that determine when a responsive layout should change to fit all the elements and components properly. In other words, if you adjust the shape of a browser window on your computer to a vertical rectangle, the website will eventually shift to the mobile version of the site.

## Plot a responsive layout

So, how do you start to build a responsive design for a website? You’ll need to plan for it from the beginning! The first thing you need is grid paper, which is paper with dots in evenly spaced rows and columns, like this:

![grid paper template](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5tjhMePwSlOY4THj8BpTrA_4597059282824baaa1952c52a5039854_Screen-Shot-2021-02-14-at-3.56.32-PM.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=fH1mTDRZjXxGp9dlB93De-BnzNxlangRQi-0Av2aiFM)

If you don’t have grid paper handy, don’t worry! There is a printable template you can use here: [Grid Paper Template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EuDT5kzUmyGNm4kdDrxH8NXHnLMWbffy/view?usp=sharing)

.

Now, you can start plotting wireframes on the grid. Placing wireframes on the grid will help you visualize the proportions of design and how those can change depending on the size of the screen. Here’s an example of wireframes plotted on grid paper, for a responsive website on three different screen sizes — a computer, tablet, and mobile phone screen.

![A paper wireframe sketch of a computer screen, tablet screen, mobile screen on grid paper showing responsiveness](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SoKEZtS8Ta6ChGbUvM2u-Q_6bf5f7c76f454a99b38913480900a8ac_Screenshot-2021-03-12-4.06.27-PM.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=tTKE4tBpwkd4QlF8ypiHNpVGtfO7Z9pbhU6gv4fnCXg)

By using grid paper, you can easily notice the size of each element and component and how they relate to one another. In this example, the responsive website has four columns of content on a laptop computer screen, three columns of content on a tablet, and two columns of content on a mobile phone-sized screen.

As you plot your own designs on grid paper and resize the layout for different screen sizes, ask yourself these questions:

- Do elements on the page need to move location? As you move from a large screen size to smaller screen sizes, which parts of the design need to stay above the fold? Which can move down the page, to below the fold?
    
- How do images need to be scaled? Are there certain images, like a hero image, that need to remain large across all screen sizes?
    
- How will you adjust the navigation elements for the page as the screen size changes, such as moving from a top navigation bar to a hamburger menu?
    

## Responsive web design is great UX

Designing a great user experience means that your website needs to look great and work effectively on various screen sizes. As you begin to create your responsive website designs, compare the layouts of existing websites — such as websites you find visually appealing or competitor websites to the product you're designing — on different screen sizes and devices. Take note of how the design adapts, and use those experiences to inspire your work.

### **Key Components of Responsive Web Design**

When designing responsive layouts for smaller screens like **mobile phones and tablets**, it's important to adjust elements for usability, accessibility, and readability. Below are three widely used components that improve the user experience.

---

### **1. Hamburger Menu (Collapsible Navigation)**
✅ **What It Is:** A navigation menu icon with three horizontal lines, resembling a hamburger.  
✅ **How It Works:** Clicking the icon **reveals hidden navigation options**, reducing clutter on small screens.  
✅ **Use Case:** Helps mobile users focus on primary content while keeping navigation easily accessible.  

---

### **2. Cards (Content Containers)**
✅ **What They Are:** Self-contained sections with **text, images, and actions** focused on a single topic.  
✅ **How They Work:** Allow users to scan relevant information quickly, ensuring **clear content hierarchy**.  
✅ **Use Case:** Featured in mobile-friendly websites for structured information display—like browsing video thumbnails or product previews.  

---

### **3. Carousels (Image & Content Sliders)**
✅ **What They Are:** Scrollable feeds of images or cards that **cycle automatically or manually**.  
✅ **How They Work:** Condense multiple items into a **single interactive space**, preventing overcrowding.  
✅ **Use Case:** Common in e-commerce sites, photography galleries, and product showcases to display multiple options **above the fold**.  

---

### **Final Thoughts on Responsive Layouts**
✅ **Text & Icon Scaling:** Shrinking text sizes ensures readability while keeping design visually appealing.  
✅ **Space Optimization:** Reducing unnecessary elements **maintains focus** on user interactions.  
✅ **Mobile-First Approach:** Plan wireframes with small screens in mind first, then **scale up to larger devices**.  

Would you like help applying these components to a wireframe you're working on? Let’s refine it together!

# Common elements used in responsive design

Designing a responsive website requires that you know how to scale elements to make the best use of available screen space, from a desktop computer to a mobile phone. Adjusting your designs based on the size of the screen might mean using different amounts of text, utilizing icons, scaling the size of images, and more. As you begin to create your own responsive designs, here are some common elements and components that you can use.

![Hamburger menu: a desktop with a hamburger menu in use to the right](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4tzUTbY8Q-yc1E22PHPsxw_0ba806fa89ef40bba669806f335375dd_Common-elements-used-in-responsive-design-1.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=h74r7UrnblFkFO8Q7-_JWLUFTQMNBMvc0viDvu5wfxw)

A **hamburger menu** is a type of navigation menu that is represented by an icon with three horizontal lines. The hamburger menu gets its name because the three lines resemble a hamburger’s top and bottom buns, with a patty in the middle!

As shown in the image above, when users click on a hamburger menu, a pop-up list unfolds to cover part of the page or even the whole screen. The expanded menu has a list of navigation options that link to various pages of the website.Typically, hamburger menus are shown at the top left corner of a website design. Hamburger menus are often featured in mobile versions of websites, because a lot of text can be placed inside of the list, which keeps the main pages of the design clean. In other words, a desktop version of a website design might have a top navigation bar that lists text horizontally across the screen, but a mobile phone screen size doesn't have room for this text, so it's placed within a hamburger menu.

![Cards: a collection of cards on a website.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/G9gndzN7TieYJ3cze64nyA_3be69928269745cd8e8f1cc0ea0ce85d_Common-elements-used-in-responsive-design-2-1-.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=5XLLlpvz2cAV1xI_9KZ1-hMGnoEsV-6qNCI2jmFONaw)

**Cards** are compact surfaces that contain content and actions about a single subject or topic. This design component gets its name because each card resembles a traditional playing card with its rectangular shape.

You’ve likely interacted with cards in a real world design, such as browsing thumbnails for online articles, organizing a Pinterest board, or swiping through profiles in an online dating app. In these examples, each card represents a new article, pin, or profile. Because cards are compact, there's little room for details. This means using cards in your designs can encourage user interactions, by teasing content that the user might want to click or tap.

Cards are also helpful when creating responsive designs because they can be easily arranged in predictable ways across devices. Each card can contain a similar amount of information from desktop to mobile designs, since little content is included. But desktop designs might include five columns of cards, while mobile designs might include only two columns of cards.

![Carousel: a carousel on both a desktop website and a mobile website](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/KXHDH4VhSJCxwx-FYZiQXg_b87042f7d8a94f85aee481ff09610b7c_Common-elements-used-in-responsive-design-3-1-.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=vJye0Z5FfzUSZ1_1fr6D3lQHTbq4oTyi2ttoFHiuRjY)

**Carousels**, or slideshows, are scrolling feeds of images or cards that can be sifted through with a click, a swipe, or on automatic loop. Think of a carousel at a carnival or shopping mall that rotates in a circle. In the same way, users can swipe through a loop of images in a carousel. You’ll often find carousels on websites with lots of images, like social media platforms and photo galleries. Carousels are also frequently featured in e-commerce websites to showcase multiple items within one page. 

Carousels may appear differently across device sizes. For example, on a desktop computer with a large screen size, you can preview multiple images in the carousel, as shown in the image above. On a mobile phone with a small screen size, the carousel can be condensed to show only one image at a time.

In addition, images within a carousel can be scaled to fit the size of the device. On desktop, carousels can be large or even take over an entire page, like a traditional slideshow would. On mobile, images within a carousel are smaller or might even change to a more compact shape, like a square instead of a rectangle.

![Call-to-action: a call-to-action button on both a desktop website and a mobile website](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Zg0cXciOT-aNHF3Ijt_mMA_fbc8e72299c544c082e6dbe97f1de64a_Common-elements-used-in-responsive-design-4-1-.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=6wRQyJ-nOE8SDSCsNQ3W0sYQ1uhUZwNxrP84MueCxS8)

A **call-to-action (CTA)** **button** is an interactive and appealing button that invites users to click on it. As shown in the image above, CTA buttons are usually emphasized in a design by using a different color or font than the rest of the design. CTA buttons are common on e-commerce websites to encourage users to "Add to cart" or "Buy now." CTA buttons are also used frequently in responsive designs to get users to take a specific action like “Sign up" or “Confirm."

Alternatively, CTA buttons can lead users to a different page within the website. For example, clicking a CTA button on the home page of a website could lead users to a detailed product description page that requires space that the home page doesn't have.

CTA buttons are used across all screen sizes in responsive design. But their appearance and function depends on each device. For example, CTA buttons might occupy more space on mobile devices than on desktop. CTA buttons might also be more interactive on mobile devices with touch screens, since they allow for more nuanced gestures beyond a simple click.
