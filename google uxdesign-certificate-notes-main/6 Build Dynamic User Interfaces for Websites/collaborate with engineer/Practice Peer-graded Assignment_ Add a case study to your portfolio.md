In this peer review, you’ll create and share a completed case study with your peers. You’ve learned that your UX design portfolio can be used to present your skills and experience as a UX designer by showcasing the collection of work that you’ve created throughout this certificate. One of the primary methods for presenting work in your portfolio is through a case study. Case studies are a visible demonstration of your design knowledge, your willingness to collaborate with a team, and your ability to see an idea through from start to finish. Each design project you complete will have its own case study. 

## **Context**

You’ll continue to add to your case study slide deck. First, you’ll refer back to the prompt you chose for the mobile app. Then, you’ll add new design assets for the responsive web designs using that same prompt. When your case study slides are complete, you’ll have the option to add the case study slide deck to an online portfolio.

## **Step 2: Provide a project overview**

When beginning a case study, it’s best to start by providing some key information about the project in an “overview” section. 

Provide:

- A brief description of the product
    
- The project duration
    
- An introduction to the problem the project is trying to solve
    
- The project’s goals
    

Then, state your role and the responsibilities you assumed throughout the project. If you worked with a team, you can include their roles here as well. 

## **Step 3: Share your empathy work**

Next, describe what you did during the empathize phase to better understand your users and their needs. This could include details about the user research you conducted, personas and problem statements, user journey maps, and sitemaps you created.

## **Step 4: Showcase your initial designs**

Now you’re ready to share iterations of your designs from paper wireframes to digital wireframes and a link to your prototype. Include notes about your goals and thought process. This allows the reader to observe from your perspective and build an understanding of the “why” behind your decisions.

Remember that each case study should be customized to the project you’re presenting. For this portfolio project, you didn’t just create designs for one screen size; you also created a responsive website. Your ability to design across various screen sizes and devices is a great skill to showcase, so it’s a good idea to include images of screen size variations. 

## **Step 5: Share usability study methods and results**

Next, you'll share your usability study methods and results. Provide a brief description of your methods. Keep it high-level enough that someone who isn’t very familiar with design can understand the process. 

Once you've introduced the parameters of your testing methods, you can share the results to help define the direction your design will take moving forward. It might be helpful to ask yourself the following questions when you present your findings:

- What were some of the biggest takeaways from the research? 
    
- How did you come to those conclusions? 
    

## **Step 6: Showcase high-fidelity designs**

Now you'll include new iterations of your design that you updated using data from the study. Showcase one to two examples of the mockups you revised based on feedback from your study participants. Don’t forget to include mockups of the screen size variations. 

It might be helpful to showcase this section in a “before and after” format. Highlight things that have changed and your reasoning behind making those design decisions. After the before and after examples, include a slide to show off key mockup screens.

## **Step 7: Include a link to a working prototype**

Your prototype allows the audience to get a feel for what it's like to use your design. Include a link to your working prototype and a summary of the user flow. Confirm that the link is working before you submit the case study. 

## **Step 8: Describe how your design accounts for accessibility** 

Making sure your design is accessible to users who may have an impairment or disability is important. In this section, provide examples of how your design accounts for accessibility. 

## **Step 9: Conclude your case study with a brief summary and next steps** 

As you reach the end of the case study, talk about the impact of your design and what you learned through the process. Detail any next steps you’d take in your project if you were to continue. By including next steps and impact, you are showing future employers your design thinking process and ability to grow through reflection. 

Finally, make sure to share your contact information so viewers can easily connect with you. 

## **Step 10: Check your work**

In order to complete a case study for your portfolio project, you will need your paper wireframes, digital wireframes, low- and high-fidelity prototypes, a usability study, and high-fidelity designs and mockups. If you haven’t completed those activities yet, go back and complete them.

## **Step 11: Review a case study exemplar**

To see one of the completed exemplars for this course item, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

## **Step 12: Review additional case study exemplars**

In the next activity, you’ll review three completed case study exemplars for a responsive website based on the three example prompts you’ve been following throughout this course:

- Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.
    
- Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.
    
- Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor its inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information. 
    

You can use these exemplars as a reference when you create your own case studies. 

## **Step 13: Share your case study** 

Having your case study in a slide deck allows you to easily share your work, including any submissions to job applications. Remember to update your portfolio with new projects.

Now that you have completed your case study, share a PDF version of it with your peers using the submission fields below.

Once you complete the activity, you can choose to review and provide constructive feedback for your peers. This is an optional activity, so do what is best for you. While this is an ungraded activity, it is a great opportunity to get feedback from your peers and see each other's work! Below are some guidelines to help you leave constructive comments for your peers. 

When giving feedback:

- Start by pointing out something positive, then follow up with a suggestion.
    
- Be specific and offer actionable recommendations.
    
- Focus on content rather than grammar or style.
