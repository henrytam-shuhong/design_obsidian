In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of case studies based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate program: 

- Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.
    
- Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.
    
- Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.
    

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in the peer-review activity, [_Add a case study to your portfolio_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/peer/PGDTi/activity-add-a-case-study-to-your-portfolio)

. Remember, your case studies should include designs for a mobile app and a responsive website for each prompt that you chose in Course 2. You can compare your own work to these examples which meet all the criteria required for a case study. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for a case study. 

# **Exemplars**

Remember, in UX design, a case study is a summarized presentation of a design project that typically includes the project goal and objectives, each team member’s role, the process the team followed, and the outcome of the project. Effective case studies demonstrate the planning, strategy, and creativity that a designer puts into each project.

## **Review of the Exemplars**

Each exemplar case study presented here includes: 

- The designers role in the project
    
- The goal of the project
    
- The target audience
    
- Key challenges and constraints
    
- Research conducted
    
- Initial concepts and design strategy
    
- Images of paper and digital wireframes
    
- Results of user testing
    
- Low- and high-fidelity mockups and prototypes
    
- Any accessibility considerations
    
- A summary of takeaways and next steps. 
    

These are the things that will show potential employers how the UX designer learned and adapted throughout the iterations of their designs. It also shows the designer’s ability to incorporate user and stakeholder feedback to improve their designs. 

## **Key takeaways**

All 3 exemplar case studies presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. They include paper wireframes, digital wireframes, low- and high-fidelity prototypes, a usability study, and high fidelity designs and mockups. Remember, case studies are a visible demonstration of your design knowledge, your willingness to collaborate with a team, and your ability to see an idea through from start to finish.

You can compare your case studies to these exemplars whenever you’re ready. As you compare, ask yourself:

Do my case studies:

- Include an overview of the project?
    
- Describe what I did to understand the users?
    
- Include my initial designs with explanations of design choices?
    
- Share information about usability studies and findings?
    
- Include mockups with explanations of design choices?
    
- Include a high-fidelity prototype?
    
- Share accessibility considerations?
    
- Conclude with a summary of lessons learned and the design impact?
    

If any of your answers are no, return to the [_Self-review activity: Add a new case study to your portfolio_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/peer/PGDTi/activity-add-a-case-study-to-your-portfolio)

and make adjustments to your case study slide decks. You can use the three exemplars provided in this reading as a reference when creating your own case studies.
