This is a very exciting part of the course because you’re about to design mockups for your responsive website. This is when your designs will start to look like a real product! 

As you begin to design mockups, remember the importance of the foundational elements of visual design. On a basic level, the term **visual design** in UX refers to how a product or technology appears to the user. If you’ve been taking the courses of the certificate program in order, in the last course, you learned about three foundational elements of visual design: typography, color, and iconography.

We won’t cover these foundational elements in this course because we assume that you learned about them in the previous course. If you need a refresher, check out this video that [introduces the foundational elements of visual design.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/5PiMP/introduction-to-foundational-elements-of-visual-design)

After that, you can revisit videos and readings that detail each of the three foundational elements of visual design that were covered, including:

- **Typography** is the practice of arranging text and typefaces, also known as fonts, to make language legible, readable, and visually appealing. Typography can help add hierarchy to your designs, make text easy to read, and add visual style. For more information, review this video about [typography in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/KuESU/typography-in-ux-design) , this video about [the importance of typography](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/Gc8PR/the-importance-of-typography), and this reading about [working with type in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/Tx6oY/work-with-type-in-mockups)- . 
    
- **Color** is one of the most impactful visual design elements. As you design, think about the messages or emotions that certain colors communicate, how people understand color, and how colors mix, match, or contrast with one another. For example, red attracts a lot of attention, while blue communicates serenity, calmness, and peace. To learn more about color, review this video about [using color in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/t5ss3/color-in-ux-design), this reading about [working with color in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/MDi11/work-with-color-in-mockups), and this reading about [accessibility considerations for using color in design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/Ca3gb/accessibility-considerations-for-color)- . 
    
- **Iconography** refers to the images or symbols associated with a subject or idea. Think of the icon for power on your computer - it’s probably a circle with a line, but most people know that this icon means power! When created effectively, icons limit wasted text space, catch the user's attention, and are an easy way to transition to another page or location. For more information about iconography, review this video about [iconography in UX design](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/item/oyuBk)
    
and this reading about [working with icons in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/t1b2M/work-with-icons-in-mockups)

Remember, for the best user experience, we recommend that you complete the courses of this certificate program in order to effectively complete your design projects and to learn the information required to successfully land a job as an entry-level UX designer. If this information is unfamiliar, you can return to complete Course 5 of the program: [Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/home/welcome)

. Good luck!
