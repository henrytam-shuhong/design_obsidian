### **Sitemaps in UX Design: Organizing Websites Effectively**

A **sitemap** is a structured diagram that outlines a website’s pages, showing how they are prioritized, linked, and labeled. It helps designers plan clear navigation paths and ensures a seamless user experience.

---

### **1. Why Are Sitemaps Important?**
✅ **Website Organization:** Helps designers visualize the site's structure and make necessary adjustments.  
✅ **Navigation Efficiency:** Ensures users can easily find content.  
✅ **Search Engine Indexing:** Helps search engines like Google understand and rank a site's content.  
✅ **Accessibility:** Assists users—including those using assistive technologies—in navigating the site effectively.  

---

### **2. Sitemap Structure**
- **Homepage (Top-Level)** → Acts as the entry point.
- **Main Categories** → Represented by rectangles linked directly to the homepage.
- **Subcategories** → Organized under each category, forming a hierarchical structure.
- **Connections Between Pages** → Indicate how users will move between sections.

This approach is commonly used for websites with **hierarchical structures**, ensuring users can follow a logical path from general to specific content.

---

### **3. How Search Engines Use Sitemaps**
- Search engines rely on sitemaps to discover and categorize website content.
- Indexed websites are more searchable, reaching users who wouldn’t have found them otherwise.

---

### **4. Accessibility & User Experience**
- A well-structured sitemap makes a site **easier to navigate for all users**, including those using screen readers or other assistive tools.
- Proper information flow enhances usability and **keeps users engaged**.

---

### **5. Next Steps: Building Your Own Sitemap**
Soon, you’ll see an example of a sitemap in action using a **library website** model. This will demonstrate how structured mapping supports intuitive navigation.

### **How to Create a Sitemap for UX Design**

A **sitemap** is a structured representation of a website’s pages, showing how content is organized and linked. It helps designers plan intuitive navigation and ensures users can access information seamlessly.

---

### **1. Planning Your Sitemap**
Before designing a sitemap, consider:
✅ **Common Website Pages:** Examples include homepage, product descriptions, shopping carts, and search results.  
✅ **Competitive Audit Insights:** Review competitor websites to identify necessary pages.  
✅ **User Research:** Utilize personas, empathy maps, user stories, and journey maps to align sitemap design with user needs.  

For example, on a **library website**, users might:
- Browse books.
- Select a book and reserve it.
- Join a waitlist if the book is unavailable.
- Pick up the book at the library.

---

### **2. Choosing a Website Structure**
Decide which structure suits your site:
- **Hierarchical Model:** Organizes content in a top-down format (homepage → main categories → subcategories).
- **Sequential Model:** Guides users through a step-by-step process (e.g., online forms).
- **Matrix Model:** Allows free navigation with interconnected pages (e.g., news websites).
- **Database Model:** Uses search functionality to retrieve content (e.g., Google Maps).

Most websites combine multiple structures for a customized experience.

---

### **3. Building Your Sitemap**
Start with a **homepage** as the top-level entry point. Then, define:
- **Main categories** (e.g., "Books," "Checkout Cart," "User Account," "About").
- **Subcategories** nested within each section (e.g., "Recent Releases," "Popular Books," "Recommendations").

Example sitemap structure for a **library website**:
```
Homepage  
│-- Books  
│   ├── Recent Releases  
│   ├── Popular Books  
│   ├── Recommendations  
│-- Checkout Cart  
│-- User Account  
│-- About  
```
Adjust and refine the sitemap as needed, ensuring logical organization for optimal navigation.

---

### **4. Benefits of a Well-Defined Sitemap**
✅ **Improves Navigation:** Helps users move efficiently through the website.  
✅ **Enhances Accessibility:** Assists all users, including those using assistive technologies.  
✅ **Supports SEO Optimization:** Search engines index sites better when sitemaps are structured clearly.  
✅ **Reduces Development Costs:** Identifies gaps early, preventing design inconsistencies.

When planning the designs for a responsive website in its early stages, it’s important to create a clear organizational path. That's where sitemaps come in handy! As a reminder, a **sitemap** is a diagram of a website or an app that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. Sitemaps help outline the pages of a website you need to design and can help you spot necessary pages that you’ve forgotten to include, need to remove, or need to combine.

Let's dive deeper into one common type of sitemap: a hierarchical sitemap.

## Hierarchical sitemap

A **hierarchical sitemap** outlines the relationship between pages in order of importance. The image below shows an example of a blank hierarchical sitemap.

- The dark gray rectangle at the top of the sitemap represents the **homepage**. Almost every website has a homepage where the user enters the site.
    
- Under the homepage, pages are listed by priority. The **parent pages**, or primary categories, connect directly to the homepage. In the example below, these pages are shown as blue rectangles. Remember, on a website, these categories usually appear in a navigation bar at the top of the home page.
    
- The **child pages**, or subcategories, connect underneath each parent page. In this example, the child pages are shown as light gray rectangles. 
    

![Empty hierarchical website structure](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ANNwYHnrQxiTcGB564MY-g_c96324fe224c45cc9fb5dd7daba4a2b4_Screen-Shot-2021-02-14-at-12.42.42-PM.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=iHs378DLsMUXMMluZiS1D9yUfIieHlggl_Ax74TFncY)

## An example sitemap: Cooking website

Imagine that you want to create a sitemap for a cooking website that has videos and recipes that teach users how to cook. Follow the steps that were outlined in the previous video to create a sitemap.

1. **Think about pages that are commonly found on websites**. As you review existing cooking websites and revisit what you've learned from the competitive audit you conducted, you notice that most cooking websites have a _search_ functionality and some kind of an _account_ section to create a profile and save recipes. You should consider whether you want to include these common pages on the website you're designing, too.
    
2. **Recall information about users**. While conducting research during the empathize phase of the design process, you learned that users want to find videos and recipes _by food type_. Users also want to be able to easily _search_ for a recipe or video.
    
3. **Decide on a website structure**. For this example, you choose to create a hierarchical sitemap because there will be one top-level page, the homepage, with pages hanging from it that users can easily find their way to.
    
4. **Start with the homepage.** In this example, the homepage is the dark gray box at the top of the sitemap.
    
5. **Name the main categories of content**. These categories will be represented in the row of blue rectangles, which are connected to the homepage. For the cooking website, you might want to have a category for _cooking videos_ and for _recipes_, since those are the types of content that the website provides. You might also want a category for _search_ and for _account_, since those are pages that are commonly found on other cooking websites and were revealed during user research.
    
6. **Add subcategories**. Remember, the subcategories are the column of gray rectangles that come below each blue rectangle. For example, you might decide to categorize _cooking videos_ by _quick fixes, slow cookers, and recommendations_. Keep in mind that categories will not necessarily have the same number of subcategories.
    

After following these steps, here’s what the sitemap of the cooking website might look like:

![A hierarchial sitemap for a cooking website that goes from the homepage to several parent and child pages.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/fAt_ZD3BR86Lf2Q9wQfOtQ_8428eb4cc9e045e0a8884b73137b74fd_Screen-Shot-2021-02-14-at-1.10.02-PM.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=A8IBxWVS1kG3mIQRU8C4EAYXeibj-sLtIHaIo23h7_E)

Homepage. Parent pages: Cooking videos, recipes, search, account. Child pages for cooking: quick fixes, slow cookers, recommendations. child pages for recipes: explore, meals, dessert. child pages for search: by ingredients, random recipe. child pages for account: my recipes, settings, my information.

Your sitemap will look different depending on the size of your website. Small websites (under 100 pages) will use a flat sitemap. **Flat sitemaps** have no more than four vertical levels. The cooking website example sitemap is considered a flat sitemap. For larger websites of 1,000 pages or more, you’ll create a **deep sitemap,** which includes five or more vertical levels. 

Remember, a clear organizational structure is key for all users to be able to move through and use your website’s design successfully. Sitemaps are the perfect tool for planning out the architecture behind your web designs.

# **Activity Overview**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jQCkI6-bRB6lqjiOVKKbdg_a793669085e347f7bff40639993c38f1_U5yd1w5CebkAIJa8oT9wn_epsKn8YPK5N2aq_K9CRx5pQxk5g0nWiVd3ZSJVZHAQG3IOsXSDAb67gb3aNNrMfYOTIn6abfB4TqteKKbIyHmxytNTb--X7MUw45UO8ks0VD1qhBXWOrXhHVkQnDkwV_A?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=zi0h2ATI-ZCtFtZwYyy7ZbACxE4FP1t08qAvb-zTLhE)

In this activity, you will practice creating a sitemap for your portfolio project. A sitemap is a diagram of a website or application that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. Sitemaps allow you to create logical, organized paths between information before you start designing your product. 

There are a few best practices when creating a sitemap:

- **Think about** pages that are commonly found on websites.
    
- **Recall** information about users.
    
- **Decide** on a website structure.
    
- **Start** with the home page.
    
- **Name** the main categories of content.
    
- **Add** subcategories.
    

By following these steps, you will create a sitemap with structure and purpose, making it easier for users to navigate the pages of your website. 

## **Step-by-step instructions**

In this activity, you’ll use the same prompt that you chose earlier in the certificate. You’ll use this prompt to complete every activity in Course 6. 

You’ll also build on the research and ideation you completed in previous activities in this course. If you haven’t completed those activities, be sure to complete them before moving on with this assignment. 

Follow the directions below to create a sitemap for your portfolio project. 

## **Step 1: Open a software program and start a new project**

The first step in creating a sitemap is choosing software that works for you. Select a program that you feel comfortable using, and start a new project file. Programs such as Google Slides, Microsoft PowerPoint, and Figma are all suitable for this kind of work. 

## **Step 2: Research existing website pages**

Before you begin creating your sitemap, think about some existing web pages you’ve visited in the past. Are there any types of pages commonly shared between sites? A “cart” page for instance, or maybe a page dedicated to searches? Take some time to consider pages that consistently appear across many different types of websites, then think about how those types of pages might apply to your responsive web app. Use this as an opportunity to draw inspiration from websites with effective information architecture. 

## **Step 3: Recall information about your users**

Gather the research you’ve already completed in previous course activities, including your [personas](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/quiz/U9lnW/activity-create-personas-for-your-portfolio-project)

, [user journey map](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/quiz/y5Ktw/activity-create-a-user-journey-map-for-your-portfolio-project), and [problem statement](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/supplement/2KE0e/review-build-problem-statements-and-hypothesis-statements&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1718648288999856&usg=AOvVaw06EOeaqDViWUNzqMIT0qNE)

. This will help you think about the structure of your sitemap before you begin. The more you can empathize with the users you’re designing for, the better navigation structure you can create for them. For example, the series of actions the user goes through in the user journey map helps you conceptualize how they might move through the pages of a website. Keep this information in mind when you begin drawing the sitemap. 

## **Step 4: Choose a website structure**

Next, decide on a website structure. The four most common structures are hierarchical, sequential, matrix, or database. Most websites use a combination of structures, so it’s up to you to decide which works best for your design. You can choose one of the four or a combination of multiple types. The structure you choose depends on how you want your pages to be laid out. Keep your user’s needs and goals in mind as you choose your website’s structure. 

## **Step 5: Add a homepage**

Remember to always start your sitemap with a homepage. To do this, start with a box at the top of your sitemap. Label it clearly, with something like “Home” or “Homepage.” Make this the clear focus of the page, because it is the first part of the user experience and the starting point for all users visiting your website. 

Compare your work to the example sitemap for the Tee's Shirts website we have been developing throughout this course.

## **Step 6: Add main content categories**

Next, add your main content categories to the sitemap. These are the categories you have chosen to be the most important pages a user visits while on the site. Thinking back to Steps 1 and 2, these are pages you identified to play an important role in the user’s journey. Add them according to the website structure you have chosen. Typically, they will appear at the top of the sitemap, either below or adjacent to the homepage bubble. Connect each bubble together with lines or arrows to demonstrate the relationships between pages.

![Sitemap showing the homepage with the main categories: Shop, Lookbooks, Search, Log in/Sign up, Cart, and Footer/Other.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ozmj6o_bT9mvgmZ6xbk3eA_84b7899c1f2b4fc3bcb31a8b344bd9f1_sZHur9BJaAS8z6xeat979FPNbDQlkENT50wpxcv_ROLsU7RmtQYD5AOSYj63lKpQXMFWIsNV-fSSPzo8rJ9_IwcPUop5IlU-4RRr6QiA5cE_l6ugeUWZ80Lpskdmzd8vffoSrgKL3zQ3FgU3DbuI3Nk?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=W1P32-PQUqQUJZbbO0UqhJ9Yj-CZeNYRP3FXr4vvb7U)

## **Step 7: Add subcategories**

Now it’s time to include pages that fall under the main content categories. These include any pages that users will visit once they are on a main content page. Revisit your research to conceptualize what pages are appropriate to include in your subcategories. Add each subcategory to your sitemap in a bubble, and connect it back to the main content category it fits under.

![Sitemap showing main categories. Under each category shows six subcategories reading left to right:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/mv6edIMzQVavS4BW9XPwlw_7442867a8d65427399b3709888db70f1_Ue_Ved7XMo_SlOQc9lwyJGRIk6vcu3VNaYvz9cVvwPpKxGfj4qJegSgaavPPY0iFH9KkMbSgbIIv4A0wBnDPMolU3ssz1JffBNxEVus2FtEh4mgupDsAyztIa5sswxKbw9tUThn5gl_Ag_E72caX60?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=X9jzlj7d8vRjGOY2wMv3xfnwn42MBa3xFO9melEmkts)

Long descriptionShop with seven subcategories below; Lookbooks with four subcategories; Search filters includes price, color, size, material, online-only, popularity, and sale; Log In/Sign up includes forgot password and create account; Cart with five subcategories; and Footer/Other which includes general information about the business and help.

Congratulations! You’ve successfully followed the steps to create a sitemap that considers the needs of your users. Once you’re finished, you should have a diagram that clearly lays out all of the pages that will appear in your website and demonstrates how users will navigate between them. 

## **Check your work**

Your work must include a completed sitemap for your portfolio project. Your sitemap should:

- Be complete
    
- Use a website structure like hierarchical, sequential, matrix, or database
    
- Include a description or illustration of a home screen or starting point
    
- Include a description or illustration of all relevant screens needed for a user to complete the intended task
    
- Use visual indicators, like arrows or a tree diagram, that exhibit the relationship between each screen

Here is an exemplar of a completed sitemap for the online clothing store example called Tee’s Shirts. This exemplar is a completed version of the activity you did earlier in the exercise. We have provided this exemplar so that you can compare your own work with an example that meets all the criteria. We also include an explanation of how the example fulfills the expectations for the activity that we outlined.

## **Exemplar**

![Sitemap showing main categories. Under each category shows six subcategories reading left to right:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/heWENVqqQYmrI3FUstiJpA_874651bae93a424ba00a774ce90d94f1_Ue_Ved7XMo_SlOQc9lwyJGRIk6vcu3VNaYvz9cVvwPpKxGfj4qJegSgaavPPY0iFH9KkMbSgbIIv4A0wBnDPMolU3ssz1JffBNxEVus2FtEh4mgupDsAyztIa5sswxKbw9tUThn5gl_Ag_E72caX60?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=8SuKnlvYGf--3FTlHv7WEbUEjTIllqgbjybUG8YVkWA)

## **Assessment of exemplar** 

**Here’s how we filled out the sitemap above:** 

**Step 1:** We started with a homepage bubble at the top. 

**Step 2:** We added the main content categories in bubbles directly underneath the homepage. All main categories are on the same level as one another.   

**Step 3:** We added subcategories for the rest of the pages of the website. We placed each subcategory in a bubble under the main content category they fit into. 

**Step 4:** For the Search feature, we added a second level of subcategories underneath the Filter bubble to show that applying filters requires a second level of navigation.

## **Compare your sitemap to the exemplar** 

Now, compare your sitemap to the matching example above. As you compare, ask yourself: 

- Did I think about pages that are commonly found on websites?
    
- Did I recall information about users?
    
- Did I decide on a website structure?
    
- Did I start with the home page?
    
- Did I name the main categories of content?
    
- Did I add subcategories?
