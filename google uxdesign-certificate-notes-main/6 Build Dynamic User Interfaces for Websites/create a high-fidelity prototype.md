You’ve learned that designing a responsive website will help diversify the work presented within your portfolio. You have worked to create designs for the prompt you selected, empathized with potential users, defined user needs, developed ideas for design solutions, and created wireframes and a low-fidelity prototype. 

Now, you’ll based on your chosen [portfolio project prompt](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/supplement/6us9z/introduction-to-second-portfolio-project)

for a responsive website.

## **High-fidelity prototypes**

As a reminder, a **high-fidelity prototype** is a representation of a final product that demonstrates its functionality. High-fidelity or “hi-fi” prototypes are a series of interconnected mockups that represent all the pages in a design. Prototypes allow designers to demonstrate how their product will look, feel, and work before passing it off to the development team. When you create a high-fidelity prototype, use the following five steps as a guide:

1. Lay out the mockups.
    
2. Connect the screens.
    
3. Add interaction details.
    
4. Adjust the animation.
    
5. Repeat the process for all screens. 
    

By following these steps, a prototype will resemble a complete design and will clearly convey your ideas to stakeholders.

Follow the instructions and answer the question to complete the activity.

## **Step 1: Lay out the mockups in Figma**

To create a high-fidelity prototype, you need to have your hi-fi mockups for your website already created. For additional guidance on creating a complete set of mockups for a website, review [Create mockups for a website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/quiz/0mI7d/activity-create-mockups-for-a-website)

. 

Start by opening your existing Figma project file with your portfolio project mockups in it. You’ll want to be working on the same page as your mockups to create your prototype. 

## **Organize the mockup screens** 

To create your prototype, you need to organize and connect your mockups together. 

It’s important to think about the user and the **user flow**, that is, how the user will interact with and navigate through a website. You can select the mockup screen you want to move in your Figma canvas, and then drag and drop it to arrange the screens in the order in which a user would interact with them.

## **Step 2: Connect the screens**

Once you have your screens organized the way you want them, you need to connect them together by performing the following steps: Switch from **Design** to **Prototype** at the top of the Inspect panel. 

![The Inspect panel in Figma showing Prototype selected.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_p4oL2eZRouWEv3WczX76A_f4667e07f47642b6b38365ed691de0f1_c-u-4gaDYzHgqYnYMm7cDUau31_jhUMc3FRC-yotSZGmYrxsi5AyewBdwgZW5-fmRd_82MXf9uGc4vd1bOSDX4ojue6p_d2sYuML5soDetRX9_lz8wZvyuH_uQfotOZ1zTaV-iV-ZDeIWN4p4qc0veh1xOG6FhK3zta5CvM2DliZ5Khb8P_rVp0dSVyG1FQ?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=sPHswA15wQLVj-uXFuFgblfa9MQP6FWest19tG5UWU4)

Then, while in the **Prototype** view, select any element to add interactivity. Once selected, a blue plus sign will appear. You can select the **plus sign** and drag it from the selected element to the screen you want it to connect to. When you release the selection on the desired destination screen, it will complete the connection. 

![The blue plus sign and arrow that connect the screens of mockups in Figma.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/kZ7OchJlSCKVrnN7Etllqg_170929a0756248029d672da042a571f1_Eop8BgASlSL5Fs9eH0_7WFa6aWt3Wsljnxrir0IdukitfUjoVoNuBnSP3l8o3vuXsfgIzVU2lcyeXi8D6nfLVZKX3wAaLAHFxuvZb9ULaIm7Pvm5yMGF2FtiQG9r2M6hdlJBUMbHBQHjCo4QKxJeqq1CpW-qwCQDLWGJRKhoO5Vkqeh9QeqfklQJAx_E0lc?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=dN0IzSkaCcQePzULf4nt46ndUBfDqpPJq93fn9_Fngw)

Remember, it’s important to think about how your users will move through the website and interact with each element. You can then make the connections based on the user flows you developed. You can also go through each element on a screen and identify what it should connect to, then draw the connection. 

## **Step 3: Add interaction details**

To add interaction details to your prototype, use triggers. **Triggers** signify the type of interactions that occur during transitions between elements. 

If you want to add or edit interactivity, click on any connection pathway and the **Interaction Details** modal will appear. This is where you can define the trigger, action, and animations for an interaction. The interactive trigger options you can use for your prototype include: 

- **On click:** This is when a user selects an element.
    
- **On drag:** This is when a user selects and drags an element.
    
- **While hovering:** This is when an action occurs after a user drags a mouse over an element.
    
- **While pressing:** This is a click and hold function, which is commonly used on mobile and tablets.
    

![The Interactive Details modal showing the On click trigger and Navigate to action selected.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HmhBUi4cTWuR_vf40G9G9A_9904d86863f9447d874d1632773e30f1_yLqb8emGljW8PhEDOKcXypzrTmMiDmScm330V0lV71ykQcN6YupSDiYXT6nd037-0A0hPwKZ_jevxuUWm0dZfm4fzkFTeUbOr0Qym5d9g4MGbggBKUYhCc7-3FSsho4e-IaK0eyGKh2mNtCBtZhoPJuf5KOX_2zTcY1ttwcSqjCnlF7zkOKC6gMHFUxpgmY?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=3AUYWD3YkYce8rZl3cgeg6atvxjZKwGP28awVJE0IGc)

The action options you may want to add include:

- **Navigate to:** This action takes you from one frame to another. This is the most common type of action used when you want to move between entire screens.
    
- **Back:** This action allows you to navigate back to a previous screen. This will simulate the Back or Home button in your prototype.
    

For each layer of interactivity, a section called **Interactions** will appear in the **Inspect panel** (right sidebar) where you can manage each interaction as well. 

The trigger you choose will vary depending on how you want users to interact with an element. For instance, **on click** is one of the most common triggers because it signifies a single click or tap of the element to interact with it. **On drag** is often used for elements like carousels because it makes more sense to interact with them by sliding side to side rather than tapping. We recommend sticking with **on click** and **on drag** triggers for this project. When designing primarily for computer screens, **on click** will be the most recognizable and intuitive trigger for users. 

Once you have applied triggers to all of your screens, you should have a finished prototype that can be navigated just like a real product. How exciting!

### **Check the trigger interactions**

To test how the chosen triggers will work, select the **Play** button in the top-right corner of the Figma window, next to the zoom options and above the Inspect panel. This will run your prototype in Present mode so you can view and test the functionality of your assigned triggers. Elements that have interactive actions assigned to them will appear blue when you click on the screen. You can also preview your prototype by selecting **Preview** from the dropdown menu.

![The Present and Preview options you can use to check your trigger interactions in your prototype.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/pJAXIOOvSvWAZZtLc0cPnA_3ab1a7cfcdab4ff4a9e1195f8d485df1_h03IPPw7loZlPDaUUyeBZQFydsDjSuz5fneJZ6iProvHBO6eSajQPOYSfE3rpNewXc2YTgc3ypW89Ee0aPiD4evRdSVl5I2vORdkog5e8RFAwQibtjbX5fw0Q5I320tEYy3I1cRkfoKWNZ3pgKvFWqIumCXkAN-ZYk5TgnbwG7un1k_6eS6Z4s-w_MHFEXc?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=8nnmyIBei6qutTa94_Jp9P184MDEuWIdS0gQYvw7lLU)

Figma saves files automatically, so no action is needed to save the prototype. 

## **Step 4: Take screenshots or export images of the mockups**

Once all of the desired trigger interactions have been added to the mockups, you can export or take screenshots of each screen in your design—they’ll be used in your case studies in the interview presentation! 

## **Screenshots**

If you are using a Mac, press **Command+Shift+3** to take a screenshot of the entire screen. If you want to select just a portion of the screen, select **Command+Shift+4**, then click and drag around the area you want to capture. 

If you’re on Windows, press **Windows+Print Screen**. 

If on a ChromeBook, press the **Ctrl+Show Windows** keys. On a ChromeBook, the **Show Windows** key looks like a rectangle with two lines on the right side, and it is located in the top row of the keyboard.

Then, using the device’s default photo viewing tool, crop and rename the screenshot files, and save them somewhere that’s easy to access.

## **Export as images**

If you want copies of your mockups to be downloaded and saved as PNG, JPG, SVG, or PDF, select the element(s) you want to export in Figma. This can be one full mockup screen, a single element within a screen, or every mockup screen on the page. Then, expand **Export** at the bottom of the Inspect panel. Select the **image type** you want to export from the dropdown menu, then select the **Export button**. To verify what is being exported, there is a **Preview** option below the export button which will allow you to see which screen(s) are being exported.

## **Step 5: Share the high-fidelity prototype**

When you’re ready to share your prototype, select **Share** (in Edit mode) or **Share Prototype** (in Present mode) in the top right of the Figma window. A window with sharing permissions will appear. Here, you can invite people to view your prototype via email, designate or update project or sharing permissions, and create a link that you can share. You can copy the link to the prototype and add it to your interview presentation along with your case studies.

![Sharing window in Figma with permissions, file links, and list of people with access.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/4f2W21KYTeO3HKP653DZsg_17f2bd3ef2434b2f97859635d66554f1_bymBEMRRhC0zFsg_714TffnVd8BN9pyxrt0yLJoOuZCsB438UsUN3I4HQYkGQquCYSntp9XORKtTKs7UbW3Gh7gW713CrE7MuNh-GKkzDezF866J15t_VvPYteEp9AetJfziuiLKLi-BCkiFKgbPyI0rXRpEeQV6vhua9DgJPmnhcM3oU6GUyI6-_jw1Yig?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=OgVN2dZcb9rWadb2BqEZb7QaB1uJp5I0qsdYSY54YGM)

You should now have a complete set of hi-fi mockups for your design completed! 

## **Step 6: Check your work**

Refer to the following list of questions to confirm what your prototype should do once you’ve organized and connected your screens and added interactive details.

Does your prototype:

- Have at least four mockup screens connected in a simulated navigational flow?
    
- Allow users to proceed forward and backward within the flow?
    
- Allow users to enter the flow from different starting points?
    
- Include clear navigation cues?
    
- Indicate successful completion of the simulated activity?
    
- Ensure that users are returned to the screen they started on after successfully completing an activity?
    
- Ensure that placeholder items have been replaced with high-fidelity assets?
    
- Include at least one screen that has two versions in different sizes—one small version for mobile and one large version for desktop—for responsive design?
    

## **Step 7: Review hi-fi prototype exemplars**

In the next activity, you’ll review three completed exemplars of hi-fi prototypes for a website based on the three example prompts you’ve been following throughout this course:

- Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.
    
- Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.
    
- Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information 
    

You can use these exemplars as a reference when you create your own hi-fi prototypes.

# Exemplars: Create a high-fidelity prototype for a responsive website

In this reading, you will review three completed exemplars of high-fidelity prototypes for responsive websites based on the three prompts that you’ve been following throughout this certificate: 

- Design an app and a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner.
    
- Design an app and a progressive website that help residents of a large city, with over 100 parks, to reserve and pay the rental fee for an outdoor pavilion for an event.
    
- Create an app and a responsive website that allow a local business to monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.
    

These exemplars range in complexity and are completed versions of the activity you completed in [Self-review: Create a high-fidelity prototype for a responsive website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/quiz/cP88V/activity-create-a-high-fidelity-prototype-for-a-responsive-website)

. You can compare your own work to these examples which meet all the criteria required for a high-fidelity prototype. There’s also a short explanation of how each exemplar meets the requirements for a high-fidelity prototype. 

## MediMatch Connect

This first example is the simplest version and includes mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of the MediMatch Connect website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user searches for medical practitioners in their area, and then can compare, select, and contact results to find the practitioner that best fits their needs. 

## Desktop homepage mockup

Below is an example of the **desktop** version of mockups for the MediMatch Connect website homepage:

## Website prototype

Below is an example of a complete prototype of the MediMatch Connect website:

![Prototype demonstrating the navigation of the MediMatch Connect website.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/knlBQS9yRGKltWOuL4HfbQ_4fb20450e9254c8e90c11675ee76c8f1_Xh06gfFLqZ2eHssZQBdDTGlHqq4SHcCQdTjG6xQke0qySKEFG2H4UpM0YVdAP4uzVuUgqNook7gHTN2xSmFIZBj6J_FqpYFPpBCAErVmXKXzXxFtvq__HPkWkNfYzuBw8vJco2SBjetl0Xd_yhRfCNSkYTLqb7TbCGv0NbxZjtVEo6kya7OBoqvhyVhe7g198GQEXdz4kQIN5z7MTmCOBT7QCf_VKE1lCDKWUw?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=KW592aM2RzFpNpM0tQTD2zphVE1n9TES1FdLC2l4FJI)

.

As you can see in this exemplar, users can easily navigate from the homepage, where they can search for a healthcare practitioner, to a results page with a list of relevant healthcare practitioners. Users can then select a doctor, go to the doctor’s profile page, and open up the “contact the specialist” window. Closing the contact window will return the user to the profile page for the selected practitioner. When the prototype runs, selectable items are highlighted in blue, and the cursor changes from an arrow to a hand indicating that an element can be selected. This exemplar demonstrates the benefits of creating a prototype for an app or a responsive website on which users can easily search for and contact a healthcare practitioner. It illustrates a simple user flow with logical navigation and accessible features.  

## Fairweather Pavilion Rentals

This second example includes mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of the Fairweather Pavilion Rental website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user searches for outdoor pavilions available in the city park system, then they can reserve and pay the rental fee for whichever one best fits their needs for their event.

## Website prototype

Below is an example of a complete prototype of the Fairweather Pavilion Rental website:

![Prototype demonstrating the navigation of the Fairweather Pavilion Rental website.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/qCbyJjjgTsWn7TVAT9vD_g_c6620b0d645147be9f2ce54d7340b0f1_mv4Mda2JjkC5W95VGW1gALZLH2P48nb5xyDfDvtVu7EB_bDEFJ4pIcVRjPDU55zC9DjgYPgHg_DwOgbE0Ji-6IZJ9_mlUV4ovuLIsyapjOWu-RLESz9purIOECC3RRGnGIGKCzaYmL1EW1Z1Kr626dOr1N0-vfIe8vBr2QxLQazfQz20TCd6O0cXzyYRUiSX_9c3xWUepCZq7gpJ-dRin6vRdVEvSPbHJ6PIOw?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=OXhlprvSiQxqg5bQe_I_I0Zo_NCEU5Jy_gD8VRjl_Pc)

.

The Fairweather Pavilion Rentals website has four mockup screens for both desktop and mobile, between which the user is able to navigate: 

- A homepage with featured pavilions; a list of pavilions which can be filtered by location, price, and capacity; and the steps for reserving a pavilion for an event
    
- A details page for the selected pavilion listing its location, price, capacity, a short description, images, and a “Book Now” button
    
- A booking page showing a calendar with available reservation dates, reservation times (beginning and ending times), the pavilion’s details, a Back button, and a Continue to payment button
    
- A payment information page listing the price of renting the selected pavilion, any taxes or fees, the total reservation amount, and a form to fill out your payment information; also, a Go Back button and a Finalize your Payment button
    

In this prototype example, the user can search for available pavilions that fit their needs for an event, and they can then reserve and book the pavilion online from anywhere, at any time. This is a great solution for users who are looking for outdoor event spaces but don’t know where to start, what’s available in their area, or how much it costs to reserve a pavilion for an event. It reduces the time that users have to spend online researching and streamlines the booking process. 

## Go>>Fresh

This third and final example includes more mockups and a more complex, high-fidelity prototype of the Go>>Fresh inventory website. In this example, there are two responsive versions of the homepage. A user can monitor their inventory, add new inventory, track inventory as sales are made, and view inventory information.

In this prototype example, the user can easily access their inventory to track sales and available stock, review statistics relating to spending and sales, and reach out to suppliers for orders. It stores all this information in a single location, so the user doesn’t have to search for hardcopies of documents or perform tasks related to inventory management manually. 

## Key takeaways

All of the example prototypes presented here are complete exemplars ranging in complexity. You can compare your high-fidelity prototypes to these exemplars whenever you’re ready.  As you compare, ask yourself:

Do my prototypes have:

- At least four mockup screens connected in a simulated navigational flow?
    
- The ability for users to proceed forward and backward within the flow?
    
- The ability for users to enter the flow from different starting points?
    
- Clear navigation cues?
    
- An indication of successful completion of the simulated activity?
    
- The ability for users to return to the screen they started on?
    
- Placeholder items that have been replaced with high-fidelity assets?
    
- Accessibility considerations for inclusive design?
    
- At least two versions of one screen in different sizes—one small version for mobile and one large version for desktop—for responsive design?
    

If any of your answers are no, return to the [_Self-review activity: Create a high-fidelity prototype for a responsive website_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/quiz/cP88V/activity-create-a-high-fidelity-prototype-for-a-responsive-website)

and make adjustments to your prototypes. You can use the three exemplars provided in this reading as a reference when creating your own prototypes. 

If you answered yes to all of the above questions, congratulations! Now you can move onto the next stage: design critiques!
