Now that your mockups are complete, it's time to transform them into a **high-fidelity prototype**—an interactive version that closely resembles the final product. Unlike low-fidelity prototypes, high-fidelity prototypes incorporate **visual details, navigation, and interactivity**.

### **1. What Makes a High-Fidelity Prototype?**
✅ **Visual Elements:** Includes **colors, images, icons, and typography** to match the final design.  
✅ **Navigation:** Allows users to move between screens smoothly.  
✅ **Interactivity:** Introduces **gestures, animations, and clickable elements** for realistic user interaction.

### **2. Refining Visuals**
🔹 **Ensure realistic content** → Replace placeholders with **finalized text, images, and links**.  
🔹 **Coordinate with teams** → If finalized assets aren’t available, use placeholders strategically.  
🔹 **Maintain brand consistency** → Verify colors, typography, and UI elements align with design standards.  

💡 **Example:** A dog walker app initially uses placeholder text like “Dog Walker A.” The high-fidelity prototype **updates this with actual names and profile photos** to simulate a real experience.

### **3. Navigation & User Flow**
🔹 **Verify that users can transition seamlessly between screens**.  
🔹 **Check placement of navigation icons (back buttons, close icons, etc.).**  
🔹 **Ask yourself:**  
  - How does a user move from **one screen to the next**?  
  - How easy is it to **find navigation elements**?  
  - Where does the **user journey end**?

### **4. Adding Interactivity in Figma**
🔹 **Create Hotspots:** Select an interactive element (e.g., buttons, icons).  
🔹 **Make Connections:** Click the **blue plus sign** to link a hotspot to its destination.  
🔹 **Define Destination:** Ensure **connections lead to entire frames/screens**, not individual items.  
🔹 **Implement Animations:** Add gestures and motion effects for a dynamic experience.  

💡 **Example:** Clicking a button on a library website should transition smoothly to the book details page.

### **5. Next Steps: Building in Figma**
Now, it’s time to **apply animations, transitions, and interactivity** to your prototype! Need help refining user flow or navigation? Let’s fine-tune it together.
