The world of UX design is full of job opportunities for all kinds of creative minds. As you complete this certificate program and find your first job in the field, it helps to be knowledgeable about the types of jobs that will be available to you! 

The video you just watched explained the different roles that UX designers can play, either as **generalist** designers with a broad number of responsibilities, or as **specialists** who dive deep into one particular facet of UX design, like interaction, visual, or motion design.

You also reviewed various job titles that you might want to explore upon completion of this certificate program, including: 

- **Interaction designers**, who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
    
- **Visual designers**, who focus on how the product or technology looks, using iconography, typography, color, space, and layouts.
    
- **Motion designers**, who think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or website.
    
- **User interface (UI) designers**, who are concerned with the look and function of a digital product’s interface, similar to visual designers.
    
- **Product designers**, who work with both visual and interaction designers and are responsible for figuring out how the whole product comes together.
    
- **UX designers,** who need generalist skills and support a broad number of responsibilities.
