### **

Once a **design critique session** ends, the presenter must **analyze and act on feedback** to refine the design. This involves reviewing notes, identifying key takeaways, and deciding on necessary revisions.

---

### **1. Reviewing Feedback**
âœ… **Check Notes or Notetaker Documentation** â†’ Ensure all feedback is properly recorded.  
âœ… **Synthesize Multiple Inputs** â†’ If several reviewers provided feedback, group common themes together.  
âœ… **Distinguish Actionable vs. Optional Feedback** â†’ Some suggestions may be **critical**, while others may be **nice-to-have**.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** If a reviewer suggested improving **button visibility**, but didnâ€™t support it with usability research, the designer might **consider but not prioritize** the change.

---

### **2. Identifying Action Items**
Once feedback is analyzed, the designer must decide:
ðŸ”¹ **Which feedback to implement** â†’ Prioritize adjustments that **enhance user experience or functionality**.  
ðŸ”¹ **Who to consult** â†’ Some feedback may require collaboration with **product managers or engineers**.  
ðŸ”¹ **How to iterate** â†’ Adjust mockups, prototypes, or user flows accordingly.

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A reviewer raises concerns about **color accessibility** for buttons. The designer should **test color contrast** and adjust shades to improve readability.

---

### **3. Acting on Feedback**
âœ… **Refine Mockups in Figma** â†’ Ensure elements align with accessibility, usability, and visual consistency.  
âœ… **Check Design Specifications** â†’ Confirm button sizes, navigation placements, and UI hierarchy.  
âœ… **Clarify Uncertain Feedback** â†’ If necessary, follow up with reviewers for **more details on suggestions**.

---

### **Final Steps: Integrating Changes into Mockups**
With feedback processed, the next phase is **integrating action items into digital designs**. This ensures a **stronger and more user-centered final product**.

### **Summary of Design Critique & Iteration Process**

A **design critique session** is an opportunity for UX designers to present their work, receive feedback, and refine their designs. After receiving feedback, designers must **analyze and synthesize** key takeaways before making changes.

---

### **1. Processing Feedback**
âœ… **Review notes or notetaker documentation** to ensure key insights are captured.  
âœ… **Distinguish critical feedback from optional suggestions** to prioritize adjustments.  
âœ… **Clarify uncertain points** by following up with reviewers if needed.  

---

### **2. Generating Action Items**
Based on feedback, designers identify necessary changes. Examples include:
- **Creating additional screens** to account for different user scenarios.  
- **Checking button sizing and placement** for consistency.  
- **Iterating on UI elements** like icons to improve clarity.  
- **Ensuring accessibility compliance** by adjusting colors for better contrast.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A reviewer suggested improving color contrast in call-to-action buttons, leading the designer to test shades using **WebAIM** and adjust to a darker shade of orange for better readability.

---

### **3. Implementing Changes in Figma**
âœ… **Refine mockups based on action items** (adjusting button sizes, iterating on icons).  
âœ… **Verify design specifications** to ensure consistency across screens.  
âœ… **Use tools like Figmaâ€™s selection panel** to streamline updates efficiently.

### **Final Thoughts**
Feedback-driven iterations lead to **stronger, user-centered designs**. Applying insights from critique sessions ensures usability, accessibility, and design clarity. Now itâ€™s time to **refine your own mockups based on feedback**â€”ready to get started?
