One challenge of designing a responsive website is figuring out creative ways to adapt the layout for different versions of the website. Earlier in the course, you used Figma to create the desktop version of your digital wireframes. Later, you created a couple of smaller versions of the wireframes for other platforms. The good news is that this means that the work for adapting the layout for the smaller versions has already been done.

You can work directly from the mobile version of your digital wireframes at the mockup stage and add in interactive elements. Just like with the desktop version of your mockups, it’s best to start at the top of the page and work down.

The instructions provided are for Figma which is the design tool used for this course. You can also use other design tools such as Adobe XD or Sketch to do the same thing. Figma can be used on any browser at no charge, which means it doesn’t require downloading to install.

## **Start at the top and work down**

To do this:

1. Navigate to **Figma** in your browser.
    
2. Sign into your account.
    
3. Open your digital wireframes.
    
4. Select the desktop version of your wireframes.
    
5. Copy and paste the wireframes onto the same page below the other frames. 
    
6. Rename the new wireframes (for example “high-fidelity mockups_mobile”)
    
7. Remember to delete the placeholder (circle, square, etc.) for each element as you add it to the mockup artboard. 
    

## **Create menus in the navigation bar**

Since the mobile view is more narrow than the desktop view, there’s not enough room for every clickable icon. To solve this challenge, use a **Hamburger menu** icon. The user can access the less important icons by tapping the hamburger menu. When the user taps (or hovers) on the menu, a **Flyout menu** appears. The flyout menu “flies out” from the side of the screen when you hover your mouse over or click on an element, and it holds the less important icons.

### Create a flyout menu

1. Create a new frame by clicking the **Frame** icon on the top of the left panel.
    
2. Navigate to the **Shapes** tool in the upper-left corner, and draw a rectangle the size of the homepage screen.
    
3. Navigate to the **Fill** tab on the right panel, and select a color.
    
4. Add in a **close button**, which allows users to close the flyout when it appears over the hamburger menu, with two rectangles that can be grouped and rotated later:
    
    1. Navigate to the **Shapes** tool and select **Rectangle**.
        
    2. Click and drag onto the canvas.
        
    3. Adjust the width and height of the rectangle in the **Properties** panel.
        
    4. Navigate to the **Text** tool; then, click the rectangle to create a new text layer on top of the button. 
        
    5. Select the **font** and **text style**, and then select both layers by clicking them as you hold the **Shift** key. Now align them using the tools underneath the **Properties** panel.
        
    6. If you plan to use this component later, they should be saved in the **Assets panel**:
        
        1. Select a frame or group of elements.
            
        2. Click the **Create Components** icon (the 4-diamond icon)
            
        3. Name the component.
            
5. Using the **Duplication** **feature** (CTRL+D or CMD+D), duplicate the group of locked interactive elements from the desktop version of your mockups. 
    
6. Resize the hero image and surrounding group of locked interactive elements based on the dimensions of the homepage.
    

### Add other mobile features

Repeat the same steps for creating other mobile version features, such as a pop-up search bar, a menu that appears when users click the search button. Adapted features like the **pop-up search bar** and flyout menu will be linked to the main artboard later, in the high-fidelity prototyping stage. 

Below, you will see an example of a mobile website that includes a hamburger menu (left image) and the flyout menu (right image).
