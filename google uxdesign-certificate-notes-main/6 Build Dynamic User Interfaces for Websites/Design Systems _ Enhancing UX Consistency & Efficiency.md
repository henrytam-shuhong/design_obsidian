# Learn more about design systems

As you‚Äôll recall, **a design system** is a series of reusable elements and guidelines that allows teams to design and develop a product, following predetermined standards. Design systems include all kinds of elements from color palettes to icons to buttons. Design systems create consistency for both designers and users, and make designing faster and easier.

If you need a refresher on design systems, review the [introduction to design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/item/Y8IFm)

video and [this video about the benefits of design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/nhIQi/benefits-of-design-systems)

.

As you create mockups, you might start developing your own design system or use an existing design system.¬†

## **Develop your own design system**

If you‚Äôre designing in Figma for projects in this program, you can put together a simple design system called a **sticker sheet**. A sticker sheet is basically a frame within Figma where you save colors and components that you can copy-and-paste into designs. Revisit this video from earlier in the certificate program if you‚Äôd like to learn more about [creating a sticker sheet in Figma](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/lecture/Q36KK/create-a-sticker-sheet-in-figma)

.

In the example below, the designer for Zia‚Äôs Pizza has a sticker sheet in place to ensure consistency for their designs. The sticker sheet shows the color and components for the logo, buttons, cards, typography, chips, colors, and icons. Now, when the designer is working on the Zia‚Äôs Pizza design, they can refer to this sticker sheet and simply copy-and-paste these items into the design, as needed.¬†

## **Utilize an existing design system**

As a UX designer, you‚Äôll¬† regularly utilize existing design systems to improve the speed and consistency of your work. Especially when you‚Äôre new to the field, design systems can help you get a feel for best practices in design and can improve the quality of your work. Check out this reading from earlier in the certificate program that [lists popular design systems](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/FuNQY/explore-popular-design-systems)

, like Google, Apple, and Microsoft, that you can consider utilizing in your own projects.¬†

You can also explore **user interface (UI) kits**, which are a collection of elements, components, and files that help UX designers create apps and websites. In other words, UI kits include design components that you don‚Äôt need to create yourself, like typography and icons. UI kits are like simplified design systems. Check out this [list of UI kits](https://www.figma.com/community/collections/ui-kits)

for Figma that you can download and use in your own designs.

# Create a sticker sheet in Figma

This review will guide you through saving design elements in Figma for future use by creating a working sticker sheet, also known as a design kit, for your mockups. A sticker sheet should list all of the most-used components and elements in your design thus far. For example, your sticker sheet could include the following UI items:

- **Components:** Reusable UI components such as buttons, menus, and cards
    
- **Typography:** Typographic elements, including fonts and font families
    
- **Color:** Color choices, including an overall palette and specific component colors
    
- **Iconography:** Icons representing recurring actions or navigation choices a user might interact with
    

We‚Äôll get to know this process by following a designer as they create a sticker sheet in Figma for the Zia‚Äôa Pizza app. When you‚Äôre ready to create your own sticker sheets, you can refer to this as a guide.¬†

## **Create a new page in a Figma file**¬†

![graphical user interface, application, Teams](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_93c0f51073b542539413da2d93ee0bf1_Frame-3-6-.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=j6KUJKchn_4__PuI5WZVWxt2Ha3wgSHy-MFDwQHtGbM)

In order to help keep things organized in the project file, designers separate different parts of a project into different pages.

To create a new page:

- Navigate to the **Pages** section of Figma towards the top-left corner of the screen.¬†
    
- Click on the + button.¬†
    
- Name the new page ‚Äú**Sticker Sheet**‚Äù by typing the name and either hitting enter or clicking off of the text-entry field.
    

## **Create a new frame**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_cb408a03ad8348999cb4800fbe3d63f1_Screenshot-2025-02-27-11.34.19-AM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=ajhqdMV2vO6jXZG6_d1krNliyIH9tBh4kb9YlxhLeUA)

New frames act as a canvas for sticker sheets. So, to get started, the designer created a new frame.¬†

To create a new frame:

- Select **Frame** from the **toolbar** near the top-left corner of the screen or use the keyboard shortcut F (on Mac and PC).¬†
    
- Select the frame labeled **Desktop**. This allows for plenty of room to create the sticker sheet.¬†
    

## **Identify UI elements to include in the sticker sheet**

At this point in the design process, the designer has already established design elements such as fonts, color, and buttons that can now be added to a sticker sheet.¬†

In the example below, the designer added the logos and buttons by simply copying the element on the artboard and pasting it into the sticker sheet frame that was just created.¬†

![An image of the start of a sticker sheet, showing two versions of the Zia‚Äôs Pizza logo.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/tFWdPnhrQEWep03Gk8mtUw_8a15f72682c34796a153b0ab40cbbff1_ncfIaI_FqwfDFQHHnTscQlRe7gEfJm6j-mdiY_obu7yQeyo7eH7bZl9O7S849-cU0MS6rqwz5ObVHw5KKoxqCBugkpaCANmh5U6c9NI3_w0E8jAnNaItQ95O83-aT_nQbOycZet0oniK_cxfvEpvuWivtLXYgQHa2OK8uPVk4qPNcZ6FYuAb-R1RtAq3pJYr2ay7m2MnPqyEimNw390zoNd67jXJRShbgIOow?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=uZv0PC15nHMb9hki6BkQevConQ7Ul7E4k1jybOH1cy0)

Next, the designer added the project colors to the sheet. To add colors to the sticker sheet, the designer first created some new shapes in the frame.¬†

To create a shape:¬†

- Select **Shape Tools** from the **toolbar** in the top-left corner of the screen.¬†
    
- Select the shape from the drop-down.
    

![graphical user interface, application, chat or text message](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_4acf3f5e505f4f1b8a466814ae2c35f1_Screenshot-2025-02-27-11.48.54-AM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=QtOIPArkESVJP3bXa5U2swbrmtHVGScR30Vpf79_sW4)

From here, the designer created three squares in the sticker sheet frame.

![An image of three gray squares added to a sticker sheet in Figma that will be used for adding color swatches.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/85DfjJCBRcGkd8jfwKMHmA_2b358c001329489a8a16d3850552e9f1_N4i_Po8PVzggDY63FyFBgvY8zkINFGA69gjKbY2aTW6XsR7ffAHbv4iatVVBZWcvOtIqYdSXcJF7FLYJTDWxcK648yR38Tn1dPWiCmchiGWfS_9MaSdE3L14f0bft0ljVYYLoVy-LWIt9rNnrr3nAX7FnT6vZgJXopODCVe1Uhtn421DN38i1dKbnVdkZzlNqhrzTDZZF7J6mzXp9qUgGzAi0UxtsVw41u85oA?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=ikCio6EnjdyLlN6Mkr0SjRlTnNCcpzHXnD-dbswodZ4)

Then, the designer found the colors to add by copying the HEX codes‚Äîthe combination of letters and numbers that define a color‚Äôs RGB (red, green, blue) value. To find a HEX code, select the element with the desired color, and the code will be in the fill section of the design tab in the right sidebar.¬†

A Figma screenshot displays a pizza order website design showing the item ordering page,¬†while the right sidebar shows matching Fill color information as a thumbnail and HEX code.

With the HEX code copied, the designer went back to the sticker sheet, selected a shape, and pasted the new HEX code into the fill section.¬†

![A Figma screenshot displays fill information, including a color thumbnail, HEX code, and transparency setting.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/v1QpN1pvSc2GpTZ6qdTUjg_7d3d724af6984d83a5ecac19d7e69bf1_sArV1oPozstMIINe2G8TCja3eCpG3SToOIvzM1FWTUudVdvv9oD2lmHsytOHtRhceLnOZDgFOhIdLj8O5thptE-Yf4x8Ex2DsXpbDjuXFBM4eFYPS6Kbr9vpbtYueUXknXCBKNrEpWWiHnAWkxdYqP-wFfEGMnGxJW53j-GCp39z9ZmrBhS0KT-L__bo6vPOnl8Eb0TaMoRItLuZrgtJpCW_7KuJP2Ct-qr9yw?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=RlBZiivWnxcvls17f7-6jFonl7nEhJqZGNAiafYJWZY)

Using this method, the designer created and saved a full color palette on their sticker sheet!¬†

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/sOyKOuyXTMi7Vtki_BPEug_248d2a7f11684fb1a1f1b28ca8fd49f1_RkAqEZsETk5F1aXrEG1SZE_IyUvaWB7hLP6OoT_rNUwwEpSw-dBMPj0FLJzVrzRxyzK8qxC8DwGy4x8eiiNbssKmNpNkxkUYlmog0bQmPMyaoc34xf_voEApYwT0xvPVjbVciw6p-Vpm279hU3GZGzM3ubXcMf-FrA8jD5BehQvbeZCeG3kT4mGMqbQNQ_A5PXDMXqmSEmYlV-aF-34vQilwp2PNZiA9mZRW4Q?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=_dNaM-NjejB-gjKsAWx0QaBAVGJzY8wdLuH7l4wZiQ8)

## **Arrange UI elements onto the sticker sheet**

Once the UI elements to include in the sticker sheet are identified, it is time to begin arranging them.¬†

The designer started by choosing a font (as a reminder from earlier assignments, you can find the font selection menu in the design tab in the right side panel) to use as a heading for the items in the sticker sheet.

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_4cef832b897c46cfb918f6d69c2c4bf1_Screenshot-2025-02-27-11.40.46-AM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=-vsp15wC_laSt5VVmFk_avURzBGJdHcr-Z8ouUUBdho)

To avoid confusion, the designer chose a font that is different from the fonts being used in the design. A standard typeface like Helvetica, Roboto, or Arial works well, for example. Using one of these typefaces makes it easier for a viewer to differentiate between a category label on your sticker sheet as opposed to a UI element from your project.

Next, the designer began arranging items in the sticker sheet by category‚Äîkeeping all the buttons together, all the icons together, etc. It is important to keep an eye on the spacing between elements in the sticker sheet. Using a grid can help keep things aligned. Without keeping the spacing in line, things can begin to appear messy pretty fast.¬†

The example below is a finished sticker sheet.

![example of a finished sticker sheet](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6X6XZ6XNQ2i8edlgrhwQZA_ea54a627d1154197ba526de58e422ff1_BKJAvcPVhIoXmbdgwKKEnBVTp947jloBnhA-dGy8IVTjiqRMtkk0w3bIWNELCDT8sy7432fKj8p0mchrSrdy6s-91PifYjdctmGE1pFI7EknB6cvalNmAtbKTdk-N2oAbm5VKfFnGJFP7fOmdy8ksfAkX5MhuEGoWnfJs8RwSB_Uy_P5fif4rDzpmUhIUsS7TctIikBm8VjaJ0RRFF9x8sDOXcYG2NjtUdTWjA?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=E4TAaLeKg_ZVogm5nnRsZWi-QCdjp0TlnEcbxe04ISo)

## **Key takeaways**

The example identifies similar types of UI elements that are categorized and grouped together: colors, typography, buttons, etc. Where there are multiple variants of an item (like an active or inactive button), both versions are included. Finally, the example labels all the individual elements that have a specific use, like the Heading 1 font as opposed to the button font.¬†

When you‚Äôre ready, you can use this as a guide to create your own sticker sheet and compare it to the example above.
