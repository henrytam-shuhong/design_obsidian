## Feedback

This is mostly a repeat of a previous module, it sounds like this course is also available as a standalone... Some of it is literally IDENTICAL, with my quizzes etc being already answered.

Previous hosts also come back!?

### **Low-Fidelity Prototypes: Understanding Functionality Before Final Design**

A **low-fidelity prototype** is an early version of a digital product that emphasizes **structure, interaction, and functionality** without finalized visuals. It allows designers to test usability before refining details.

---

### **1. What Are Prototypes?**
Prototypes fall into two categories:
âœ… **Low-Fidelity Prototypes:** Basic interactive structures used to explore ideas and test navigation.  
âœ… **High-Fidelity Prototypes:** Fully polished designs that closely resemble the final product, including realistic content and interactions.

---

### **2. Key Differences Between Wireframes & Low-Fidelity Prototypes**
- **Wireframes:** Static **blueprints** of a websiteâ€™s structure.  
- **Low-Fidelity Prototypes:** Functional **interactive versions** connecting multiple wireframes to simulate user flow.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A wireframe simply lays out a homepage structure, whereas a prototype lets users click through to other sections.

---

### **3. Why Build a Low-Fidelity Prototype?**
âœ… **Allows Early Testing:** Helps identify usability issues before finalizing designs.  
âœ… **Enhances Navigation Flow:** Ensures users can complete tasks successfully.  
âœ… **Reduces Development Errors:** Saves time and money by catching problems early.

### **4. Next Steps: Creating a Prototype**
ðŸ”¹ **Refine wireframes** based on feedback.  
ðŸ”¹ **Add basic interactions** (button clicks, page transitions).  
ðŸ”¹ **Test usability** with real users to gather insights.  

Now itâ€™s time to put theory into action! Need tips on setting up interactions? Letâ€™s explore further!

### **Wireframes vs. Mockups: Understanding the Design Evolution**

Wireframes and mockups are essential steps in the UX design process, helping designers transition from **conceptual structure** to **visual refinement**.

---

### **1. Wireframes (Structural Blueprints)**
âœ… **Definition:** Simplified sketches or digital outlines of a productâ€™s layout.  
âœ… **Purpose:** Establishes **structure** and hierarchy without distractions like colors or typography.  
âœ… **Best For:** Quickly brainstorming ideas and organizing content before refining visuals.  

---

### **2. Mockups (Visual Representation)**
âœ… **Definition:** Static **high-fidelity** designs showcasing the final look of a product.  
âœ… **Purpose:** Helps designers and collaborators visualize UI elements, including **typography, colors, and icons**.  
âœ… **Key Difference:** Unlike prototypes, mockups **arenâ€™t interactive** but allow iterations without impacting functionality.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** The wireframe for a dog walker app outlines layout with placeholders, while the mockup introduces **color, iconography, and refined design** to enhance usability.

---

### **3. Iterating from Wireframes to Mockups**
ðŸ”¹ **Mockups allow flexibility** â†’ Designers can refine layout placement for aesthetics and usability.  
ðŸ”¹ **Encourages feedback loops** â†’ Iteration ensures improvements before finalizing designs.  
ðŸ”¹ **Helps visualize user flow** â†’ Mapping interactions improves navigation clarity.
