### **Website Homepage Layouts & Best Practices**

A website‚Äôs homepage is a crucial entry point that sets the tone for navigation and usability. Several common homepage layouts cater to different user needs and content presentation styles.

---

### **1. Single-Column Layout**
- **Structure:** Content is stacked vertically in a single column.  
- **Best For:** Blogs, mobile websites, and minimalist designs.  
- **Example:** Medium‚Äîwhere articles appear in a streamlined, top-to-bottom layout.  

---

### **2. Multi-Column Layout**
- **Structure:** Two or more columns divide content strategically.  
- **Best For:** Desktop websites, product pages, and information-heavy sites.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **Two-Column:** Focal point on one side, supporting text on the other (e.g., Grow with Google).  
  - **Three-Column:** Displays more content above the fold (e.g., recipe websites).  

---

### **3. Box Layout**
- **Structure:** Uses flexible square or rectangular sections for categorized content.  
- **Best For:** E-commerce sites, UX portfolios, and seasonal promotions.  
- **Example:** Nordstrom‚Äîorganizing holiday gift categories in neatly defined boxes.  

---

### **4. Featured Image Layout**
- **Structure:** A large, bold image or video dominates the page, with minimal text.  
- **Best For:** Product pages, brand storytelling, and emotional engagement.  
- **Example:** Caledon Build‚Äîusing a striking full-screen image with a sticky menu.  

---

### **5. Asymmetrical Layout (F-Shape & Z-Shape)**
- **Structure:** Deliberately imbalanced design to highlight key areas.  
- **Best For:** Search result pages, content-heavy sites, and marketing pages.  
- **Examples:**  
  - **F-Shape:** Content is scanned top-down in an "F" pattern (e.g., search results).  
  - **Z-Shape:** Users scan diagonally, then left-to-right (common in Western layouts).  

---

### **6. Grid of Cards**
- **Structure:** Uniformly sized content previews arranged in a grid.  
- **Best For:** Recipe blogs, streaming services, and interactive galleries.  
- **Examples:** Pinterest, YouTube, and Dribbble‚Äîwhere cards preview detailed content.  

---

### **7. Tiered Layer Cake Layout**
- **Structure:** Stacked horizontal layers containing different numbers of columns.  
- **Best For:** Responsive web designs with adaptable sections.  
- **Example:** Strider Bikes‚Äîutilizing distinct sections for text, icons, and images.  

---

### **Final Thoughts**
‚úÖ **Usability Matters:** Pick a layout that enhances navigation, accessibility, and user experience.  
‚úÖ **Trends vs. Functionality:** What‚Äôs popular may not always be best‚Äîdesign for users, not just aesthetics.  
‚úÖ **Customization:** Websites often blend multiple layouts for a tailored experience.

# wireframes

The moment has finally come: You‚Äôre ready to put pen to paper and begin to draw your responsive website designs! It's time to create **wireframes**, which are outlines or sketches of a product or a screen. You‚Äôll start by creating paper wireframes, then you'll move to digital wireframes later.

Remember, wireframes help establish the basic layout of a screen. A **layout** is the structure that supports how visual components on a page are arranged, like images, text, and icons. You can apply everything you just learned about common website layouts when you create wireframes for your responsive website.¬†

To help get your ideas flowing, here are the wireframes of five versions of the homepage of the Wisconsin Public Library website, that Dave created:¬†

![Layout A. B, and C of the Wisconsin Library homepage](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/UpJ_f5B2RBOSf3-QdoQTfQ_13e5ddc60af749d0b6195d5f8ef139ef_learn-more-about-wireframes-1.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=C6FaFBR78_73rzDeJlpcutuEkGubMqC5ln4MAMkNJFg)

![Layout D and E of the Wisconsin Library homepage](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/D55eDWaYSUaeXg1mmOlGjA_df17f308ddd44338a7ccf2e1f0497c37_learn-more-aboute-wirframes-2.svg?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=bKdm0nMhJO5jGXkyTSdq3o1zUSbRpkJ5DAGJWpAUzE8)

- **Layout A**: A large hero image with text next to it, where an author or featured collection of books could be showcased.¬†
    
- **Layout B**: A prominent search field in the top right.
    
- **Layout C:** The logo, search, and navigation are grouped into one floating box. Other images and text are placed further down the page.¬†
    
- **Layout D**: The discover, about, and donate areas of the website are part of the homepage.
    
- **Layout E**: The search bar is prominently featured.

### **Wireframes in UX Design: Structuring Your Website Layout**

Wireframes are essential blueprints for a website‚Äôs design. They outline the layout of a page using **simple shapes, lines, and minimal text** to establish structure before visual elements are finalized.

---

### **1. What is a Wireframe?**
‚úÖ **Definition:** A sketch or digital outline of a website's structure.  
‚úÖ **Purpose:** Helps designers map out how features and content will appear.  
‚úÖ **Bare Bones Approach:** Uses placeholders for images, text, and buttons to maintain focus on **functionality** rather than aesthetics.  

---

### **2. Wireframing Methods**
- **Paper Wireframing:** Quick sketching to explore multiple ideas.  
- **Digital Wireframing:** Uses tools like Figma or Adobe XD for refined layouts.  
üí° **Best Practice:** Start with paper sketches to iterate quickly before transitioning to digital.  

---

### **3. Creating a Wireframe: Step-by-Step**
1Ô∏è‚É£ **List Key Information** ‚Üí Identify essential elements for the page. Example: Homepage needs a **navigation bar, hero image, book covers, and descriptions**.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ **Sketch Multiple Variations** ‚Üí Aim for **five different wireframes** for the same page to explore multiple design ideas.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ **Add Placeholders** ‚Üí Represent text with **horizontal lines**, images with **squares and X marks**, and buttons with **rectangles or circles**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ **Structure the Layout Logically** ‚Üí Consider **above-the-fold content**, user navigation patterns, and responsiveness.  
5Ô∏è‚É£ **Refine the Best Features** ‚Üí Identify and combine elements from different wireframes to create the strongest version.  

---

### **4. Why Wireframing is Important?**
‚úÖ **Encourages Iteration:** Rapid idea generation before finalizing layouts.  
‚úÖ **Improves User Experience:** Allows designers to focus on usability rather than visuals.  
‚úÖ **Streamlines Development:** Provides developers with a clear roadmap for structuring content.  

---

### **5. Next Steps**
Now, it‚Äôs time to create **your own paper wireframes** for a desktop design! Experiment with different approaches, **test creative ideas**, and refine the structure before moving to digital tools.

# Create paper wireframes for a responsive website

# **Part 1: Create paper wireframes for a homepage**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jQCkI6-bRB6lqjiOVKKbdg_a793669085e347f7bff40639993c38f1_U5yd1w5CebkAIJa8oT9wn_epsKn8YPK5N2aq_K9CRx5pQxk5g0nWiVd3ZSJVZHAQG3IOsXSDAb67gb3aNNrMfYOTIn6abfB4TqteKKbIyHmxytNTb--X7MUw45UO8ks0VD1qhBXWOrXhHVkQnDkwV_A?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=zi0h2ATI-ZCtFtZwYyy7ZbACxE4FP1t08qAvb-zTLhE)

## **Introduction**

This review will go through an example set of paper wireframes created for Tee‚Äôs Shirts. We‚Äôll review how to build a set of paper wireframes, how to select the best components of each wireframe, and how to integrate selected elements to create one finished product.¬†

If you are taking this Certificate in order, you learned about sketching paper wireframes earlier in Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes, but if any of this information seems unfamiliar to you or you need to review the basics about creating paper wireframes, consider reviewing the [Course 3 materials](https://www.coursera.org/learn/wireframes-low-fidelity-prototypes/home/week/1)

.¬†

Remember, while a designer will have a completed paper wireframe at the end of this process, designs develop overtime, and the content, layout, and UI elements will be iterated on throughout the design process

Let‚Äôs start by reviewing how a designer for Tee‚Äôs Shirts completed the steps for creating paper wireframes for the homepage of a new responsive website.

## **Start with pen and paper**

Wireframes are an important step in starting to build the basic outline of your website. The best part is that, as the designer, you only need a few sheets of grid paper and a pen to get started.¬†

## **Focus on which elements to include based on the sitemap**

Remember, a sitemap is a diagram of a website or application that shows how pages are prioritized, linked, and labeled. You should have created one in an earlier activity: Build a sitemap for your website.¬† If you haven‚Äôt done so already, we recommend you complete the sitemap activity first.¬†

Here‚Äôs an example of a sitemap that a designer created earlier for the website of clothing store Tee‚Äôs Shirts:

![Flow chart showing the website structure for a clothing store organized into six sections reading left to right:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/j7ntkG7zQwKK5Eq_2joN-A_650ac94cfae544e39d5ae7dbd33528f1_35Fs79k1cIUbwwCUaMN5TYFm1pMvisv7BQiOBi0lWOQD4umM--fIhTDn5YjOoZWAnEaOJ_eM9J-iRr6ZJmr8YYDmrb4Fe3DA0dUpT8uRKNcJTXXh9nUi0Fbl5s1eV-igXasE4dnjOwVsvUg2XWJsU74X-JUPGyyBhFnINSw5yMHxhcz1dBr7D2wK3-nhiNA?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=XIFVM8sjXzy9VtaeRwILO__zqMDMf-h7QzehkLEjXpM)

Chart: Men‚Äôs clothing with 7 categories below; Women‚Äôs clothing with 7 categories; Search filters includes price, color, size, material, online-only, popularity and sale; Log In/Sign up includes forgot password and create account; Cart with 5 options; and Footer/Other which includes general information about the business and help.

Using the information from the sitemap, the designer can start to sketch paper wireframes. They sketched four versions using three basic elements: lines, shapes (like rectangles and circles), and text placeholders to represent the elements from the site map.¬†

In the example below, the designer created the first homepage sketch by:

- Drawing a rectangle on a piece of paper to represent the homepage
    
- Filling in the rectangle with placeholders: shapes, lines, or text that hold the place for visual or UI elements that will be filled in later
    

![Image d'une esquisse de maquette fonctionnelle papier repr√©sentant les √©l√©ments cl√©s d'une application de bureau.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/sE6gHewnRBWf3rnbpAlSAw_5615aac83b1341de884c8d2f7d167ff1_bV672NxVDj62JGibhLzkJN5mca2aGlB1Ld_e8bWmLx5Wmehsf7acn5aZlo39niI8PNxugnWbeZBk_0Wit-EGs11EuTaHTCsoTpD8xzmLpbeHmjPz8EgAokpkIE-9W52rwceT4ZPW-4qr20jzgxmAqyOFpJYee92r6iXB-tVrn0bP1wUStbqRtCz6TDheszE?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=w8wCQrcMfSJ-AOJ5cPRWpzWTc0jh2qMG9fD4StEOPkA)

The boxes marked with an X represent images and the horizontal lines represent on-screen text, while circles and arrows represent buttons.

These placeholders will be filled with images or components later when the paper wireframes are converted into digital wireframes.¬†

Although this doesn‚Äôt appear in this example, rectangles or squares with text inside can indicate call-to-action buttons (visual prompts that tell a user to take an action). The large NEXT button at the bottom of a webpage is a good example of a common call-to-action button. Sometimes you will hear this referred to as a CTA.

Then, the designer repeated this step three times to create a total of four homepage wireframes.

![Une s√©rie d'esquisses de maquettes fonctionnelles papier pr√©sente quatre it√©rations diff√©rentes de la page d'accueil d'une ap](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Q8fxSd4qS7aqc2KfKHJRCA_001cd9970ea148938dbfc7061bc840f1_MPXEv_n8iGgvmHIKIGfKJP1G3gv2xld2kX8JiMRrAsHMaRQpmexvEqkQF27sps7OnGJQdV4p23GhObv2keeSYX5o9DVwdX4pnzGiy_yT9ZuCobnJ_WDpbqmtRXKIKHUaQSg9HOimNakUjdBdqd0XSgQOX9NthJTOlfC7U4BrAcT5zPXvJ-OJ0Xu-8EhArpY?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=Zy1V5LQEOTGwZCX3QOI7w0zQg7_drnTjqO_WmpgTrNc)

Each sketch presents the same content elements, arranged in different layouts. These variations show the designer's exploration of diverse combinations of images, text, and buttons, aiming to generate as many ideas as possible within a limited timeframe.

## Choose the best parts of the four sketches

After creating all four paper wireframes, the designer studied them, decided on the best sections of each wireframe, and marked their favorite elements with a star.¬†

![Each star represents the section that the designer chooses to bring to a final consolidated design.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/A_aT-f4GRPyM3VGkGK7l0w_7e4d7d63f1534c17b55ad220f09452f1_0zfbSzaMeOHb9WobC63ZPgqIkHeOUC4YXYPvCrIfBIFXXt9G610SeUnsQW6OBr1eN53o42q2rfmRKqW0EfpW1GZS9ME7-sIIUbgzIKwQeyalhMvgvWuBPXBDX80bvGqBzPftFHjqZslChr0wlouYVDwvozb_NWuMZ7TjWWQVMs063Wpbmaxj3ZTycXXfrP4?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=ODSzrKgV0N4myA7q_awrFZrOfUadSEY7SPuvPnutPSg)

## Combine starred elements to create a new paper wireframe of the homepage¬†

With four versions of the homepage created, the designer used the variations to combine the starred elements to create one website homepage. The example below is a new homepage made from all the elements the designer starred.¬†

![Esquisse de maquette fonctionnelle de la page d'accueil d'une application de bureau regroupant les meilleures parties des qua](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/bqTm8RQcSu6DmBH-EWBQ8A_7cdb7cde2e6a46c793216d818b8416f1_Kr6ctwdHFIAoOSn4d7TcIZ3C-nfVDS67H8bnR2Y9ShBVgr77nq7yng9oznJGdDPwsYazK_XMAPf9QRMPLhz3Gxtjfb78i0IpJAim3bUOjk6vQOm5gUwE-eCR_A9oWWjSeSBnZMtRjiOBWZ0jxtVIur-1U-8nLJ2WWgyl25c_syB7ZMNLgTUrCFlmNdo7lZ8?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=JNBIwysUhdg8-D8tos-CW9O66rGm0_3_PkAEET9vFEQ)

A wireframe sketch of a desktop app home page representing the best parts consolidated from the four sketches in one final design.

## **Repeat process for the remaining pages of the website**

Next, the designer applied the same process to the rest of the website pages:

- Sketch four versions of wireframes.¬†
    
- Review the variations of each page and star the best parts.
    
- Combine the starred sections into a single wireframe.¬†
    

In this review so far, we‚Äôve covered how to create a full set of paper wireframes for a desktop screen. Now let‚Äôs switch focus to creating paper wireframes for other screen sizes, so that pages on a website can change automatically depending on the size of the device.¬†

# **Part 2: Create variations of paper wireframes for different screen sizes**

![](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jQCkI6-bRB6lqjiOVKKbdg_a793669085e347f7bff40639993c38f1_U5yd1w5CebkAIJa8oT9wn_epsKn8YPK5N2aq_K9CRx5pQxk5g0nWiVd3ZSJVZHAQG3IOsXSDAb67gb3aNNrMfYOTIn6abfB4TqteKKbIyHmxytNTb--X7MUw45UO8ks0VD1qhBXWOrXhHVkQnDkwV_A?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=zi0h2ATI-ZCtFtZwYyy7ZbACxE4FP1t08qAvb-zTLhE)

## **Introduction**

Now, we‚Äôll go through the process of creating variations of paper wireframes that will be needed for a responsive website, and we‚Äôll cover how a designer plots wireframes on a paper grid and plans design considerations for adaptive screen sizes.¬†

Remember that responsive web design means implementing changes to the appearance or layout of a website, depending on the device being used to view it and the size of the screen. Devices come in all shapes and sizes, so planning for adaptive screen sizes will improve your user experience and accessibility across a range of devices.

Let‚Äôs review how the designer for Tee‚Äôs Shirts continued working on their wireframes in order to create variations for the homepage.

## **Review the completed paper wireframes**

For this example, the designer uses the completed wireframe of the homepage from earlier.

![Esquisse de maquette fonctionnelle d'une page d'accueil d'application de bureau regroupant les meilleures parties de la phase](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/b6h7pTKQSJWb8JvUvEEIDw_8744ffb44aa8474289ae2ed72c80b2f1_Kr6ctwdHFIAoOSn4d7TcIZ3C-nfVDS67H8bnR2Y9ShBVgr77nq7yng9oznJGdDPwsYazK_XMAPf9QRMPLhz3Gxtjfb78i0IpJAim3bUOjk6vQOm5gUwE-eCR_A9oWWjSeSBnZMtRjiOBWZ0jxtVIur-1U-8nLJ2WWgyl25c_syB7ZMNLgTUrCFlmNdo7lZ8?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=d7SXiytYwNfQ75o13weTUmrCCeJP8zfxXBXV084VXWM)

A wireframe sketch of a desktop app home page representing the best parts from the sketching phase, consolidated into one final design.

### **Gather the wireframing tools**

To complete this section, the designer needed:

- A pen or pencil
    
- Grid paper or a printout of the [grid paper template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EuDT5kzUmyGNm4kdDrxH8NXHnLMWbffy/view)
    

### **Grid paper template**

When you‚Äôre ready to work on your paper wireframes, if you need grid paper, you can access and print [the grid paper template](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EuDT5kzUmyGNm4kdDrxH8NXHnLMWbffy/view)

:

- Download the template.
    
- From here, make sure you have a printer connected to your computer, and select the printer icon at the top-right of the page.¬†
    
- Save the file to your computer, then print it.¬†
    

## **Create two versions of a homepage that account for different screen sizes**

Next, it‚Äôs time to add responsive web design to the homepage. Assume the desktop homepage wireframe is the largest screen to design for. In order to create smaller versions, a designer should ask: ‚ÄúWhat would a medium version look like?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhat would a small version look like?‚Äù¬†

In the examples below, we‚Äôll review how the designer created the homepage variations on grid paper.

### **Example of paper wireframe for mobile**¬†

For a phone screen, the designer drew a screen outline that is smaller than the desktop size, and longer than it is wide. Then, using the lines of the grid as a placement guide, moved and scaled the elements from the desktop homepage onto the new mobile size.¬†

![Deux esquisses de maquettes fonctionnelles c√¥te √† c√¥te montrent comment le concepteur a r√©utilis√© l'esquisse de maquette fonc](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/jEpHiUNbR4uXDNPQkZm-Uw_17b98f09e1414a2d991287935daef3f1__mtwR3PlLEQ74io5JUTiOnvRd11pviELBppkzu-B7cfIDytZ3ZkZ6WSemCiMIYSjuYo6-X6KkII5YkwN_qDrHeCjjtb3heoBNjN5NTwZp4xB79q8vJ2ngb8-4acFpsb0d30G9gW5rMPfDjJlknf-V0vBuO-hj4CN701-XatGyTx1BfGWMaNOG9hlj6bh42A?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=H93-CRpQYux7Mey_Uwx_ukCZOEYZGhaHT7dLf2Aixio)

Two wireframe sketches side by side showcase how the designer took the wireframe sketches from the desktop version on the left and transferred the design to a mobile format on grid paper. The lines in the grid paper provide a guide to move and scale elements in proportion.

## Example of paper wireframe for tablets

For the tablet screen, the designer drew an outline larger than a mobile screen, but is still longer than it is wide and will clearly represent the intended device. Then, using the lines of the grid as a placement guide, the designer moved and scaled the elements from the desktop homepage onto the new tablet size.¬†

![Une esquisse de maquette fonctionnelle sur du papier quadrill√© montre comment le concepteur a r√©utilis√© les esquisses de la v](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/1V-O4zB9TKOw_V-JuXWTaQ_045bfdde11524d81ad50b52d06513cf1_FhU_DXSJfpiJg5LilHO-WFRdwxLT-gY4RoQw5T9v10fj5nAN1mNY-KwWqIr0W346rif7LS3150y9ALlhMJ-b6scfay2SLX0yr8Bvi6cf-QX34np-QdNGrjhQvUYxuu2OS-70LeBR6haZ9pJN0hBNzQ1YKqW-d6tpP8EbOWiKUp8u0IkpPM0VfpW-oBj8o7g?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=gReYdZZ58fa9xyySmjECk4_Ep40lWGTpQp0hPvRPh5w)

and transferred the design to a tablet format. The lines in the grid paper provide a guide to move and scale elements in proportion.

## Designer tips:

When you‚Äôre ready to work on your own paper wireframe variations for your responsive website, here are some tips:

- Be sure to carefully consider which UI components will be removed, which will stay, and which will shift position or change their format.¬†
    
- Three common elements that save space on smaller screens are hamburger menus, cards, and carousels. These elements were discussed in [the video on adjusting page layouts based on screen size](https://www.coursera.org/learn/responsive-web-design-adobe-xd/lecture/Sk3k2/adjust-page-layouts-based-on-screen-size)
    

- .¬†
    

## **Key takeaways**

When you are ready to create your own paper wireframes for your responsive website, you can compare your wireframes to the examples provided here.

As you compare, ask yourself the following questions.

For the desktop version:

- Did I create four versions of the homepage wireframe?
    
- Did I create placeholders for visual elements that will be added in later?
    
- Did I analyze the wireframes and decide on the best designs?
    
- Did I create a final homepage design with the best elements from the first four wireframes?
    
- Did I repeat the same process to create the wireframes for the other pages of the website?
    

For different screen sizes:

- Did I think about usability when designing for smaller screen sizes?
    
- Did I consider accessibility when designing for new screen sizes?¬†
    
- Did I try to reduce clutter and save space when designing for new screen sizes?
