# Create digital wireframes for a desktop screen size

As you‚Äôve learned, transitioning from low-fidelity paper wireframes to low-fidelity digital wireframes is a big step, so it‚Äôs important that designers ask themselves some key questions before starting:

- Is there a clear understanding of the layout of the website? It‚Äôs important to carefully consider the homepage layout in the wireframing stage. There are several homepage layouts that you‚Äôve learned about in this course.
    
- Have a few iterations been created of the paper wireframes?
    
- Has any feedback about the paper wireframes led to new insights that can be incorporated?¬†
    
- Is it time to start considering various visual elements, like typography, color, and images that will go into later versions of the digital designs?
    

This checklist helps designers make sure that the transition to digital wireframes is happening at the correct stage of the design process.

Now, we‚Äôll review how a designer created digital wireframe for the desktop version of the Tee‚Äôs Shirts website. Later, you‚Äôll review how to adapt the digital wireframes you create for smaller screen sizes, like tablets or mobile phones.¬†

## **Create a frame in Figma**

![Capture d'√©cran de Figma montrant l'emplacement o√π un cadre est cr√©√©.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/C98PAtguQxSz2uf53xCu9A_026e68399a7148d5a7bb6adc7d2f3bf1_JxM75w83rOBgaJkKxQhSbrrOZfb4BqI69IcCyGBLbclcB70Y6ELLUqDOerCSEto3Shkm4Q1n1w3Moa-kAWEDMgLqY15KQ-wG_E_Ijl0fTA5XClWMvA3TinKbltWeSOzjX9ZW92eWdc8FJCNO-VEl9MRZjCrVKjmBNY5C0cq03EtPob72R2tJAziwL_2wfs8?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=_IexPk06kIprZlsk8NbKr3NJ6EF9Vu2bbGGhBMbyLyY)

The first step is to create a page that holds all the pages of each app or website to be designed. To do this, the designer needed to start by creating a working area for the project in Figma by following these steps.¬†

1. Open Figma and create a new design file for their project.¬†
    
2. Create a frame by clicking on the **Frame** tool located on the upper-left toolbar‚Äîor by using the shortcut (F).¬†
    
3. Then, on the right sidebar under **Frame**, use the drop-down option and choose the **Wireframe** size (1440x1024). This frame is suitable for designing web pages.¬†
    
4. Rename the frame by double-clicking the frame name in the layers panel located on the left to indicate that it is the homepage.¬†
    

## **Study paper wireframes and apply a layout grid**

The designer had already created paper wireframes for the desktop version of a responsive website. So, to help remember the layout preferences for the digital wireframes, they took a picture of the paper wireframes, and then uploaded the images onto the frame in Figma.¬†

The paper wireframes were created on gridded paper because the grids on the paper help designers control spacing and placement of elements that are part of the layout. Preparing a digital version of the grid in Figma will make sure the content is aligned consistently.

Applying the layout grid in Figma includes three elements:¬†

- **Margins:** the distance between the edge of the frame and the layout grid¬†
    
- **Columns:** the vertical columns that are evenly spaced on the grid¬†
    
- **Gutter width:** the white space between each column
    

![Capture d'√©cran de l'interface Figma montrant une grille de mise en page √† 10¬†colonnes.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/zllZ70_lSXCuaYC6vD1Syw_26ccc1edb933463083f602a87588c9f1_ChDkz0pqbb30fEmabl9EQA1OoQi_pN7oST5FhMF92UlThEIoRstNxHqVD1yi2cSu9bGnfLTtRx6WNhqR_NBUzaOQMZbDXmrbpVB-EUw17Kl1Wfwf_R78B8Zlmnz_Y-aICwqyGBmKNNY8Dk-I_nqRo7fRZe4MnoVpodt-l1p78SlOJEYQ2V_5XfX0ejgMTdk?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=xfe2fIBfDnR1hflI2bgR7rxySH5F8LycGwNWZ3MOfSc)

To specify the layout grid, the designer needs to complete the following steps:

1. Select the frame where the layout grid is needed.
    
2. In the right-hand sidebar, go to the **Layout Grid** section and click on the ‚Äú+‚Äù button to create a new grid.
    
3. Click on the grid icon to the left of the new grid to open the grid panel.
    
4. Use the drop-down menu to change the view from **Grid** to **Columns.**
    
5. Enter the count and color of columns and adjust the other properties of the columns according to the design requirements, such as the type, width, and gutter size.
    
6. Once all the desired properties are set, close the panel or click outside of the grid settings panel.
    

## **Populate the frame with placeholders**

Once the grid was set up, the designer could start building the outline of the homepage by filling in the space with different sized rectangles, circles, and squares.

Keep in mind where the fold of the webpage is. The fold is the term used to describe the bottom border of the browser screen. Content that appears above the fold is visible without scrolling, whereas content that appears below the fold refers to any portion contained further down the webpage.

The top half, or the above-the-fold half of the homepage, is for the content that actually appears on screen when a user accesses the website from a computer.¬† The above-the-fold half includes the:

- Navigation bar: has placeholders for your logo, or call-to-action buttons like the search button
    
- Body section: contains images and accompanying text about the product
    

## **Homepage example - above the fold**

![Captures d'√©cran de maquettes fonctionnelles de la page d'accueil montrant la partie au-dessus de la ligne de flottaison.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/7NomjU0dTwO4Jlkv86pXeQ_51985dca14974601af57046c8de82bf1_Above_the_fold.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=rbfP0h4mASAy6y5WeJ7kvQZhrdqZO-yrGqvb2_K956U)

The lower half, or the below-the-fold half of the homepage, is for the content that users need to scroll down to access on the homepage. The below-the-fold half includes:

- The lower half of the body section
    
- The footer section, which holds things like contact information, social media links, and the main logo
    

## **Homepage example - below the fold**

![Captures d'√©cran montrant des espaces r√©serv√©s pour le texte et les graphiques en-dessous de la ligne de flottaison sur la ma](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/B8f6nwDdQOyz4_aOg6GiqA_fb2debb4468b43348d422b1361f5b5f1_Below_the_fold.png?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=t2d8yYmc0-dwZRspSuQQgzA6mJtlKM1vMW_DGF8KYqA)

There are no strict rules for how to lay out the page, but common practice is to include the navigation bar and any main calls to action above the fold. That way, users are presented with the more important elements immediately upon accessing the webpage. Designing with the fold in mind helps ensure the hierarchy of content is effective.¬†

## **Add placeholder text**

Next, the designer went back to the images of their paper wireframes. All the sections with placeholders containing lines were replaced with text that indicates each section. It‚Äôs not important to write in all the text at this stage; so the designer just needed to fill in enough placeholder text to act as a guide for when high-fidelity designs were developed later.

To indicate a section or heading, the designer created a short phrase to remember where to add text later. For body text, designers generally use lorem ipsum, Latin placeholder text that identifies where content will go and how a page will be laid out, without adding meaningful content. Search online for ‚Äúlorem ipsum,‚Äù then copy and paste the text from there.

Here‚Äôs an example of using lorem ipsum as placeholder text:

![Image de la mise en page d'une maquette fonctionnelle pour quatre produits avec un contenu d'espace r√©serv√©.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/g6FW0NhHRPugec8ePV-CEQ_83d958c25e024d08ae6fa5615ee801f1_zh13lgY7vNaW9A-Yn8d_DQAhiH8uXb7BCQTV0mXGF93MmvrvL3knpEB5oL2AERlF_CyAY3e4N27-qBdO1P-0r0tmp04cly1H1TUOgtJfSBycfdRDAvxTPg8KcDEawf84G09WDBUaIVrsOEZ3pSt4b48EK7rVAUuyS47g39QAciz9cQv0IjeT38WReP6uQi8?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=LEvJ9fVjecmdf1YAHBLhGGhekOC1RU_PJGyTlyXIc20)

## **Repeat for the all pages**¬†

The designer then applied the same process to the rest of their desktop wireframes.¬†

![Mise en page pour plusieurs maquettes fonctionnelles pour ordinateur avec contenu d'espace r√©serv√©.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6lZWe9b6S1G8lodhyKQweQ_66cad6f9fa2d4ce2bbd360be3c6c36f1_owT0tRwg8h9Sl8k7Es733RKpMvhbLkfSWpSKGNSxDfVdDGIL69eLC3uqafcc3u7w7z5TQnsONjAYLlRm2eARFpzBoZWSfcEpoz2g8-n3XBl9dkG9-MkhcmwVqdgRbEEXAt2nyg0x1fLZTq-VCWy3R5sy5xKFpGW9gK1iUy-kScTrMe7egYQ2bW-VkIfj6Fs?expiry=1745280000000&hmac=gYhIzCoFXeMMywJwRjCiFGuLpBQBpgL-lTaamxCDW_k)

## **Key takeaways**

When you‚Äôre ready, you can use this review as a guide to create your own digital wireframes and compare your work to the examples.

As you compare, ask yourself:¬†

- Did I use my paper wireframes as a guide?
    
- Did I create digital wireframes that include every stage of the user flow, starting at the homepage?
    
- Did I create placeholders (rectangles, squares, and circles) for all the visual elements that will be added in later?
    
- Did I use lorem ipsum as a placeholder for the body text?![[Google UX Design Certificate - Complete Tee's Shirts Digital Wireframe Exemplar.pdf]]

### **Accessibility Considerations in Digital Wireframes**

Ensuring **accessibility** in digital wireframes allows users of **all abilities** to navigate a website effectively, including those using assistive technologies. Below are three key features to implement:

---

### **1. Headings (Improving Navigation & Hierarchy)**
‚úÖ **What They Are:** Titles and subtitles that define page sections.  
‚úÖ **Why They Matter:**  
- **Support visual hierarchy** (larger and bold text distinguishes key sections).  
- **Assist screen readers** (users can **jump between headings** for easier navigation).  
‚úÖ **Implementation Tip:**  
- Annotate wireframes with **heading tags (e.g., H1, H2)** to help developers structure content.  

üí° **Example:** On a **library website**, a "Featured Author" section would be labeled with an **H2 heading**, making it a recognizable subcategory.

---

### **2. Landmarks (Guiding Users Across Sections)**
‚úÖ **What They Are:** Interface features that define key regions of a website.  
‚úÖ **Why They Matter:**  
- **Assistive technology users** rely on landmarks for quick navigation.  
- **Provide structure for navigation bars, search boxes, and footers**.  
‚úÖ **Implementation Tip:**  
- Annotate interface regions to ensure **proper mapping for screen readers**.  

üí° **Example:** On **iOS devices**, the **VoiceOver rotor tool** helps users browse through **headings and landmarks** using **Ctrl + Option + U**.

---

### **3. Initial Focus (Directing User Attention)**
‚úÖ **What It Is:** Ensures the **most important element is immediately visible** upon loading the page.  
‚úÖ **Why It Matters:**  
- Guides users to their **primary task**, avoiding distractions.  
- Prevents **cognitive overload** by maintaining a clutter-free interface.  
‚úÖ **Implementation Tip:**  
- Use **H1 headings or prominent elements** to define focus areas.  

üí° **Example:** Google‚Äôs **homepage** places the **search bar front and center**, directing users toward **its primary function**.

---

### **Final Thoughts**
‚úÖ **Improves usability** ‚Üí Helps users of all abilities interact with the website smoothly.  
‚úÖ **Enhances inclusivity** ‚Üí Ensures accessibility standards are met.  
‚úÖ **Supports structured development** ‚Üí Wireframe annotations guide implementation.  

**Next Steps:** Review your wireframes and **apply accessibility principles** before transitioning to high-fidelity designs. Need help refining your wireframes? Let‚Äôs collaborate!

### **Applying Gestalt Principles to Wireframes**

Gestalt Principles help designers organize content effectively, making websites and apps more **intuitive** and **visually cohesive**. Here are three principles that can elevate your wireframes:

---

### **1. Similarity (Recognizing Related Elements)**
‚úÖ **What It Is:** Elements that look alike‚Äîwhether in shape, color, or size‚Äîare perceived as having the same function.  
‚úÖ **Why It Matters:** Reinforces **consistency**, allowing users to understand relationships between items at a glance.  
üí° **Example:** In the **library website wireframe**, book sections in "Popular at WCL" have **identical rectangles** for book covers with accompanying text for title and author. This tells users the sections serve the same purpose.

---

### **2. Proximity (Grouping Related Content)**
‚úÖ **What It Is:** Elements placed close together appear more related than those spaced apart.  
‚úÖ **Why It Matters:** Helps **users quickly identify** logical connections without extra labels.  
üí° **Example:** In "Featured Collections," groups of **three book covers** placed close together indicate they belong in the same collection, while **spaced-out book groups** signify separate collections.

---

### **3. Common Region (Defining Sections Clearly)**
‚úÖ **What It Is:** Elements enclosed within the same area are perceived as a group.  
‚úÖ **Why It Matters:** Provides **visual separation** to distinguish different content sections.  
üí° **Example:** The **featured author section** is enclosed within a box, with a **header, title, and description**, clearly showing users that **all text pertains to the highlighted author**.

---

### **Next Steps: Enhancing Wireframes**
‚úÖ **Refine layouts using Gestalt Principles** to improve user perception.  
‚úÖ **Consider spacing, alignment, and enclosed regions** for better clarity.  
‚úÖ **Experiment with different arrangements** to see what resonates with users.
