Web accessibility ensures that websites are usable by **people with disabilities**, including those relying on assistive technologies. The **Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)** provide clear standards for improving accessibility in UX design.

---

### **1. Annotations (Helping Assistive Technologies Navigate)**
âœ… **What They Are:** Markers placed next to interactive UI elements, such as call-to-action buttons.  
âœ… **Why They Matter:**  
- Define **traversal order** (the sequence assistive technologies follow when reading a webpage).  
- Help users navigate with **keyboard tabbing**, improving usability for those who donâ€™t use a mouse or touchscreen.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** In a dog walker app, annotations indicate how a screen reader should move **sequentially through a form**.

---

### **2. Hierarchal Headings (Improving Content Structure)**
âœ… **What They Are:** Organized text headings (e.g., **H1, H2, H3**) defining content hierarchy.  
âœ… **Why They Matter:**  
- Help screen readers **scan content** efficiently.  
- Ensure readability by **scaling text size** based on importance.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A library website might use **H1 for "Library Catalog"**, **H2 for "Featured Books"**, and **H3 for book categories**, ensuring logical reading order.

---

### **3. Labels (Enhancing Interactive Elements for Screen Readers)**
âœ… **What They Are:** Descriptive text attached to interactive UI elements (buttons, links, forms).  
âœ… **Why They Matter:**  
- Clarify **purpose and function** for assistive technologies.  
- Group related controls (e.g., checkboxes) to **improve efficiency** for screen reader users.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** In Gmail, the **floating action button** is labeled **"Compose"**, guiding users clearly toward email creation.

### **Final Steps: Applying Accessibility Principles**
âœ… **Enhance screen reader navigation** â†’ Use annotations for traversal order.  
âœ… **Define heading hierarchy** â†’ Assign **clear and structured heading tags**.  
âœ… **Improve interactive clarity** â†’ Label buttons and controls for intuitive navigation.
