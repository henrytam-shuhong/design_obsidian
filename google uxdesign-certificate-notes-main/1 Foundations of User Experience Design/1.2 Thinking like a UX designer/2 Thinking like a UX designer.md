## Universal design

- Universal design: One product for all users, one-size-fits-all.
- Inclusive design: Solve for one, extend to many.
- Equity-focused design: Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented. Making sure product is accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilities.
  - Equality: Providing same amount of opportunity & support
  - Equity: Providing different levels of opportunity & support to achieve same outcome.

## Platforms

### Mobile

Average session is 72 seconds (desktop 150). Users are goal orientated, trying to complete a single task.

- CTAs front and centre
- Nav menus short and simple, only core functions
- Use tapping, swiping
- Design for landscape or portrait (hmmmm...)
- Reduce visual clutter

## User-centred design

1. Understand: How user experiences the product (or similar)
2. Specify: What're their needs? What problem are we solving?
3. Design: How can we solve that problem?
4. Evaluate: Does our solution solve the problem? Test with real user!

## Assisted Technologies (AT)

Products / equipments / systems that enhance learning / working / daily living for people with disabilities.

- Colour modification: High contrast mode, dark mode.
- Voice control / switch devices: A switch is something like eye tracking.
- Screen readers
- Alternative text

## Feedback

The deep dive into pronouns and equity was... strange. Some aspect of it is absolutely needed to ensure all users are considered, but the depth was a little over the top. Perhaps this content is reused elsewhere? Especially jarring as the next topic in the same category was platforms!

All the non-main-host videos were remote, which unfortunately had a lower audio and video quality. Perhaps this course was created during COVID-19?

Much shorter than module 1.
