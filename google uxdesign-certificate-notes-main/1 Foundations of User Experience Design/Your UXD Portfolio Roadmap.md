To earn the Google User Experience (UX) Design certificate, you must complete a portfolio that showcases 3 major UXD projects and 3 case studies. These projects are designed to help you become job-ready and enter the field of UX Design. You will develop portions of this portfolio in each of the 7 courses in the certificate program. You’ll complete the assignments related to Project 1 (Mobile App) in Courses 2 through 5, Project 2 (Responsive Web Design) in Course 6, and Project 3 (Design a User Experience for Social Good) in Course 7. By the time you have finished this certificate, you'll have designed two mobile apps and two responsive websites.

The three case studies will reflect the assignments and projects you’ve completed throughout each course. Case studies demonstrate your design knowledge, your ability to collaborate with a team, and your skill for following through on an idea from start to finish, despite challenges. [Adding case studies to your portfolio](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zyqoc1125wnStwfpGwhmJw0PAjtr9-Dt7i0o7a7DYGw/template/preview "case study template") will help future employers get a better understanding of who you are as a designer and how you work through the process of building a product.

### **Practice Activities**

Practice activities are assigned throughout each course as an opportunity to apply the concepts that you learned. Each practice activity is also a chance to develop your personal brand as a UX designer. After you complete a practice activity, you can compare your work to an example from a professional in the field.

There’s one basic difference between these practice activities and your portfolio project: everyone enrolled in the course is presented with the same prompts for practice activities, whereas there is a specific prompt for each of your portfolio projects.

Practice activities are not required for the portfolio, but may be added if you feel they are an appropriate representation of your work.
