An iterative, user-centred framework.

1. Empathize: Learn about the user, step back from assumptions / guesses.
   - Questionnaires, surveys, in-person interviews, phone interviews, video interviews.
   - Empathy maps can process the data collected, e.g. who are users, what do they say / think about their experiences, and what do they do / feel before, during, after experiences?
   - User personas (segments represented by fictional entity).
2. Define: Analyse findings, determine which user problems are most important. Outcome is a clear statement of what need will be solved by design.
   - User story, e.g. "as x, I want to y, so that z".
   - User journeys, e.g. the steps the user takes to try and achieve their goal.
   - Problem statements: X is a Y who needs Z because ABC. Like user stories, but from designer perspective.
3. Ideate: Brainstorming, generate solutions. Start making choices about best options to prototype.
   - "How might we?"
   - "Crazy Eights" / Rapid Sketching: 8 minutes, 1 minute per square / box, propose a solution in each.
   - See what competitors do, weaknesses, strengths.
   - SCAMPER used to brainstorm ideas and changes: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Rearrange.
4. Prototype: Build a basic model, might be static or on paper.
   - Wireframes (paper or digital).
   - Low fidelity prototypes: Basic wireframes with interactivity for navigating etc.
   - High fidelity prototypes: Realistic content and interactions on top of low-fidelity.
5. Test: Let users try the prototypes, incorporate their feedback.
   - Who will participate?
   - What kind of tests?
   - When, where, why are tests being conducted?
   - Validate ideas / info / decisions
   - Uncover usability issues
   - How will participants engage?
   - How will info be collected?

## Design sprints

Time bound, five phases typically spread over 5x 8hr days. Goal is to solve critical design challenge by designing, prototyping, testing solutions. Different departments can use!

Benefits:

- Save time
- Create path to bring product to market
- Prioritize the user
- Test product before launch
- Value every person in the room
- Best designs float to the top
- Lowers risks to launching
- Versatile, can be used at any point in a project

When to sprint:

- Many potential solutions to challenge?
- Cross-functional teams needed to weigh in?
- Challenge scope wide enough to justify?

Stages (each phase takes up to a day):

1. Understand: Get a clear picture of the design challenge. Learn from experts, have creative discussions with other departments / industries.
2. Ideate: Come up with ideas, sketch and present ideas.
3. Decide: Decide which solutions to build based on goals / challenge. End day by blueprinting prototype.
4. Prototype: Goal is something realistic enough to test with users. Also finish user test schedule.
5. Testing: Observe, interview.

How to plan:

- User research to identify the actual challenge
- Talk to experts (or colleagues) for during "Understand"
- Find the right space physically, e.g. acoustics, furniture, whiteboard.
- Gather supplies (very literal, paper / pen / snacks)
- Establish sprint rules (e.g. no phones)
- Plan introductions (e.g. icebreakers)
- Post-sprint planning (documenting, next steps)
