As you determine the layout of elements on the pages of your mockups, be sure to consider containment. As a reminder, **containment** uses visual barriers to keep designs neat and organized. In other words, barriers like lines or colors help limit content to a specific section of a design.

You were introduced to four methods of containment in the previous video: dividers, borders, fill, and shadow. In this reading, you'll get a better understanding of how to create each of these containment methods in Figma.

## Create dividers

**Dividers** are single lines that separate sections of content in a design. Dividers can be simple yet effective tools for quickly breaking up content that doesn’t belong together. Adding a divider in Figma is pretty simple, but you need to know how the sections of your mockups relate to each other in order to determine where dividers should be placed.

To create a divider in Figma:

1. Identify sections of content in your mockup that need to be separate from one another.
    
2. In the toolbar at the top left of the screen, select the **Rectangle** tool, which is represented by an icon that looks like a square.
    
3. Select **Line** from the dropdown menu, as shown in the image below.

4. Choose the area of your mockup where you’d like to draw the divider. Click and drag your mouse to pull a straight line across the Frame.

5. Click on the new line that was added to your mockup to select it. In the Design panel on the right side of the screen, go to the **Stroke** section, where you can control the look of the line you created. Select a color for the line and the line size, as shown in the image below.

## Add borders

**Borders** are continuous lines that form shapes, like rectangles, that break up sections of a page. Borders usually form around a specific design element or important text. Adding a border can differentiate between pieces of content in your designs.

To add a border in Figma:

1. Identify the content that you feel needs to stand out from the rest of the content in the mockup.
    
2. In the toolbar at the top left of the screen, select the **Rectangle** tool, which is represented by an icon that looks like a square.
    
3. Draw a rectangle on your **Frame**. Resize the rectangle to fit around the outside of the element that you want to emphasize. 
    
4. In the Design panel on the right side of the screen, go to the **Fill** section. Remove the fill from the rectangle you’ve created.
    
5. Go to the **Stroke** section of the design panel. Add a stroke to the rectangle using the **plus (+)** icon on the right side. The stroke will outline the rectangle.
    
6. Use the **weight field** to select a weight or thickness of the stroke, in pixels. Enter a value in the field provided, or scroll through values using your mouse/trackpad while the field is in focus.

.

## Select fill

**Fill** assigns colors to objects in your design. The color you choose will fill in the design element, which makes content stand out on your page.

To select fill in Figma:

1. Click to select a Layer in your design that you want to add fill to.
    
2. In the Design panel on the right side of the screen, go to the **Fill** section. Click the **plus (+)** icon to add a fill to the layer.
    
3. Figma will add a default **solid** fill with a hex value of C4C4C4. Click on the small colored rectangle, or fill swatch, to open the color picker. You can use the color picker to select any color to fill your shape.

## Apply shadow

**Shadows** create dimensions, especially when used in combination with borders or fill. There are two different types of shadows: drop shadows and inner shadows. 

- Drop shadows come directly off of the element and can go in any direction. Drop shadows are perfect for making buttons feel like they’re coming off of the page. 
    
- Inner shadows move inward onto the element. Inner shadows are a great way to show that a button is being pressed. 
    

To apply a drop shadow in Figma:

1. Click to select a **Layer** in your design that you want to add a shadow to.
    
2. In the Design panel on the right side of the screen, go to the **Effects** section. The drop shadow effect is applied by default, as shown in the image below.
    
3. Adjust the drop shadow using the **Effect settings** icon, which looks like a sun. Feel free to play around with a few different shadow options in order to find one that you want to use in your mockups!

To apply an inner shadow in Figma:

1. In the Design panel on the right side of the screen, go to the **Effects** section. The dropdown menu is on drop shadow by default. Click on the arrow to view the rest of the dropdown menu, and select Inner shadow.
    
2. Adjust the drop shadow using the **Effect settings** icon, which looks like a sun. The effect is subtle, but you should notice a shadow inside of the shapes you’ve selected.
