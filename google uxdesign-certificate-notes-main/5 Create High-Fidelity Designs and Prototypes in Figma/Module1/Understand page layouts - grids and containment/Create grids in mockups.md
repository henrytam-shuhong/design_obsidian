Grids are a helpful and practical tool to use as you create designs. Grids give consistency and structure to your design, and they help ensure that your designs fit within the screen boundaries.

![Basic grid and Layout grid examples on Figma](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/S4X59jbzRj2F-fY282Y9Dw_195afe22314f41089c699fdc3420cce0_Screen-Shot-2021-03-10-at-9.24.15-AM.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=7YdSVNZaXg967bJJLSNieb7wpD26JCSfFRp4UCTf5EE)

Remember, a **basic grid** has intersecting lines that divide pages into small squares that allow you to easily lay out elements in a design. If you used grid paper to draw your wireframes, a basic grid will look familiar! A basic grid is on the left in the image above.

Basic grids are useful to help you design consistently, but UX designers more commonly use layout grids. A **layout grid** is a series of columns and alleys that allow you to organize elements in a design. Columns are the colored blocks, and alleys are the uncolored spaces between the columns. A layout grid is shown on the right in the image above. You can also apply more than one grid to a frame and edit them separately. So let's explore how to use grids in Figma!

## Create and apply grids

To apply a layout grid to your designs in Figma:

1. Select the **Frame** in the **Layers** panel or on the canvas. If you're working on a file you've already started designing, be sure that you’re selecting the Frame and not another element’s layer by accident. 
    
2. On the right side of the screen is the **Properties** panel. In the **Layout grid** section, click the **+** icon.
    
3. By default, a basic grid, which Figma calls a **Uniform Grid**, will be applied to the Frame. Uniform grid gets it's name because all of the squares in the grid are a uniform size.
    
4. You can update the properties by clicking on the icon with nine squares, in the shape of a square, to the left of **Grid** to open the **Layout grid** settings.
    

Check out Figma’s Help Center to learn some [tips for using grids](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-Layout-Grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows#h_001df3c9-cf3c-473f-a4c5-278d9c212524)

and to explore [types of grids (uniform, column, row)](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids/layout-grid-basics/)

, including a visual with an example of each type of grid.

## Align the elements to a grid

A **control** is a feature that helps you align design elements. In Figma, controls are located at the top of the Properties panel. Aligning the elements on your Frame to a grid will help your layout appear even, organized, and "tidy," as Figma describes it.

Here are the controls in Figma, in the order listed below:

![Figma alignment panel](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/exZiH1WFTBCWYh9VhRwQVA_c8dd6db25420427183f0a0fc84b6c113_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-2.49.02-AM.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=DMguKCcoTC11wQb7X0K7G0vqa28P3xlrciE3BrS1O94)

- Align left
    
- Align horizontal centers
    
- Align right
    
- Align top
    
- Align vertical centers
    
- Distribute horizontally
    
- Distribute vertically
    
- Tidy up

in this article from Figma’s Help Center.

## Auto Layout

Another feature in Figma that you might want to use when creating mockups is Auto Layout. With **Auto Layout**, your designs can shrink or grow in response to a change. For example, you can create buttons that grow or shrink as you edit their text label.

There are a few ways you can add Auto Layout, such as:

1. Select a frame, then click the **plus (+) icon** next to Auto Layout in the right sidebar.
    
2. Right-click the frame or object, then select **Add Auto Layout**.
    
3. Use the keyboard shortcut **Shift + A**.

# Create grids in project mockups

You’ve learned that grids will help you decide where to place elements in mockups. There are a few reasons to use grids. They:

- Create clarity and consistency by making it easier to scan the elements on the screen.
    
- Quicken the design process by making it faster to place elements on the screen.
    
- Make it easier to collaborate on designs, since designers will generally know where to place things using the grids in your designs.
    

You’ve also explored the Figma functions that will help you [create, customize, and align grids in your mockups.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/U8TTJ/create-grids-in-mockups)

Now, you'll review a completed example that shows how grids were applied to the Zia's Pizza app.

![Figma canvas with two high-fidelity mockups of Zia’s Pizza app.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/Q5cxtkouRjeiTwsef28i9w_12fb5804fb604ca1a7813def2dc9aef1_DI2luhmfspwdRMFGEz1Fiimad2Ziy_6mnGx4T94QKtgPtAxvuaILEtriCQOsMkWN3FizpmgGn10RiD7nDvZNfMrsxCuHXuSqj_RPZ7PbdN-7Y_0MssVUM50CP2YwTAA0HBO9hiK3QyQx0W1fhN8i2A0?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=WA0M5y08q2IdQ-jPDsyuyCJlTxIUiPKkneDOdT16TBQ)

Figma canvas with two high-fidelity mockups of Zia’s Pizza app. Left mockup includes layout grid of pink vertical columns and white vertical alleys. Right mockup includes Uniform Grid of intersecting, evenly spaced vertical and horizontal lines.

## Create grids in a high-fidelity Figma mockup

In the example, the designer applied a layout grid to the hi-fi mockup on the left and a basic grid to the hi-fi mockup on the right. Remember that Figma refers to a basic grid as a Uniform Grid. 

When you’re ready to apply grids to your mockups, use these steps:

1. Select a frame in the layers panel on the left or click the panel in the canvas.
    
2. Click the plus (+) icon next to the layout grid in the design panel on the right. By default, a Uniform Grid will be applied to the frame.
    

![graphical user interface, application](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_9b66608d7c6e4f3a8f9b8823494ec9f1_Frame-10-1-.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=b4fLEJQite3gRI5SSIvPoidmncNbG6TJnhyxSjBv8PI)

![Figma canvas with design panel to right. On the canvas, a frame with default Uniform Grid applied.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_9fc7a100a1d14a74b84709457734a1f1_Screenshot-2025-02-26-11.32.24-AM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=3JtuGulfcpm_OuSY3DDh4nCjvGLNvt7VkMe736hN1oo)

## Customize grids

Next, in the example, the designer customized their grids for a mobile app. 

When you’re ready to customize the grids in your mockups, you can update a grid’s properties by clicking on the grid icon in the design panel on the right to open the layout grid settings. 

If you’re working on a mobile app, use the steps below to apply the grid settings that are recommended for mobile apps:

1. Click the grid icon to open the layout grid settings. 
    
2. Click the grid drop-down menu and select columns.
    
3. Make any changes needed to match the following grid settings:
    
    1. Count: 5
        
    2. Color: FF0000 10%
        
    3. Type: Stretch
        
    4. Width: Auto
        
    5. Margin: 0
        

![chart](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_59bc32e0e42d436d9b93b9e63d1b0ff1_Screenshot-2025-02-26-11.38.26-AM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=Pqz9BMYgWTd-Gkl2E5M_MkVtdLQAVIPJF53L4vjFtiA)

This grid provides structure to help you arrange the elements in your design to fit within the boundaries of a smartphone screen without cluttering the frame. 

## Align UI components with the grid

Finally, the designer for Zia’s Pizza added UI items to their frames and aligned those items with the grids. For instance, notice how the buttons span the width of the grid and are aligned to the edge of the columns. The icons in the header and the image for "Today's Top Pizza" also have their edges aligned to the grid.

When you’re ready to add and align UI items in your mockups, here are some guidelines: 

First, you can: 

- Align the edges of your components along the edges of the grid columns
    
- Align components to fit within the center of the grid columns
    
- Use a mix of these two alignment methods
    

Next, click and drag each UI component in the canvas to adjust its position. 

Finally, use Figma’s align features to adjust the alignment of a component or multiple components at once. Review [Figma’s help article and video on aligning objects](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956814-Adjust-the-alignment-or-distribution-of-layers)

to learn more about these features.

In addition to Figma’s align features, you might also find the auto layout feature helpful. Auto layout allows you to resize or redistribute UI components to automatically fit the frame they’re in. There’s a lot you can do with this feature, and [Figma’s help article on auto layout](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040451373-Create-dynamic-designs-with-Auto-Layout)

will guide you through each function.

As you design with grids in the future, feel free to edit your grid settings to best meet your design needs and preferences. Selecting a frame and clicking the grid icon will reopen the grid settings for that frame. Check out this [article from Figma about grid basics](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040450513-Create-Layout-Grids-with-grids-columns-and-rows#h_001df3c9-cf3c-473f-a4c5-278d9c212524)

and this [article from Figma about the types of grids](https://www.figma.com/best-practices/everything-you-need-to-know-about-layout-grids/layout-grid-basics/)

. The latter includes examples of each type of grid to help you see how you might edit your grids in the future to best meet your needs.

## Key takeaways

Grids are powerful tools for designing and aligning elements with consistency and efficiency. When used effectively, they’ll save you time and yield better designs throughout your project portfolio, for which you’re aiming to create 3–5 complete design projects.
