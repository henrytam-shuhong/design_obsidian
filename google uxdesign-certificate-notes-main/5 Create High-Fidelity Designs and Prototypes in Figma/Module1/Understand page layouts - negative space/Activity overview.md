In your project portfolio, remember that you’re aiming for 3–5 complete design projects. Throughout the week, you have learned how to build mockups for these projects. Specifically, you have learned how to:

- Add and apply visual design elements to your mockups
    
- Create and define typography in your mockups
    
- Add and define color in your mockups
    
- Create and apply icons in your mockups
    
- Create and apply dividers or borders to your mockups
    
- Review and revise negative space in your mockup
    

Now, it is time for you to create your mockups (if you haven’t already) and review your work. 

# **Step-by-step instructions**

## **Step 1: Review the examples**

Before you review your own work, take a moment to review the examples you’ve explored in previous readings. You can refer to these examples for comparison as you assess your mockups.

## **Step 2: Review your typography**

Does your mockup use a clearly defined and consistent set of typefaces and fonts to:

- Create hierarchy between different pieces of information?
    
- Make text accessible and easy to read?
    
- Convey the brand associated with the product?
    

Consider the example for comparison. The largest fonts are reserved for the logo and headers, like “Today’s Top Pizza” and “Checkout,” which creates a clear hierarchy and draws users’ attention to key pieces of information. The logo’s Permanent Marker typeface is a handwriting-style typeface. This dynamic style draws attention to the app’s logo and brand, but it’s used the least because it’s the most difficult to read. The rest of the written content uses various fonts in two sans serif typefaces, Oswald and Roboto. This choice maintains consistency while allowing for a broad range of hierarchical levels. 

## **Step 3: Review your color**

Does your mockup use a clearly defined and consistent color palette to:

- Add emphasis and grab attention?
    
- Create variety and accessibility?
    
- Communicate the product’s brand?
    
- Achieve the 60/30/10 rule?
    

For comparison, the example applies green and red colors to create a bright, friendly design that evokes the Zia’s Pizza brand. These colors are different from pizza apps that have come before, which helps Zia’s stand out. 

Notice how the designer uses a 60/30/10 color palette to achieve the key effects of color:

- Roughly 60 percent of the design is solid white. White is a minimal background that lets other elements and colors stand out.
    
- Roughly 30 percent of the design includes more neutral colors: black, pastel green, and pastel red. The black text is easy to read, while the pastels highlight key areas of information, like “Today’s Top Pizza,” and convey the app’s brand. The pastels are distinct enough to draw attention but light enough to allow accent colors to stand out.
    
- Roughly 10 percent of the design includes bright red and vibrant green as accent colors. The bright red is used more liberally for headers, subheaders, buttons, and icons. Red is a bold color that attracts attention, making the elements stand out. It is especially useful in places where the user is being called to action. The vibrant green is used more sparingly to highlight the names of specialty pizzas. 
    

## **Step 4: Review your icons**

Does your mockup use inclusive and accessible icons to:

- Save space by condensing text into visuals?
    
- Draw users’ attention to key actions or pieces of information?
    
- Help users easily navigate the app?
    
- Convey the app’s brand?
    

Consider how the example uses icons for navigation, to help users find what they need. There is a mix of industry-standard, commonly recognized icons (like the home icon), as well as icons that are more specific to this app and its brand (like the pizza icon). For something that doesn’t have an industry standard or a specific icon, you should make sure to validate it with testing. In this example, the + (plus sign) for “Build Your Own” is a choice that works for now, but it could be worth investigating that icon during usability testing. Regardless, in context, all of these icons clearly identify what they do and make it easier for a user to navigate in the product.

## **Step 5: Review your containment** 

Does your mockup use containment (dividers, borders, fill, and shadow) to:

- Separate sections?
    
- Make the screen look organized?
    
- Make navigation easier?
    

In the example, there are dividers and borders between pieces of content and around specific elements. By adding dividers under the top navigation bar and between the section header and the content of the page, the designer makes it easier for users to differentiate between parts of the screen. These dividers are a full width divider and an inset divider, respectively. The full width divider shows a stronger separation than the inset divider, which separates different content on the same page. 

Additionally, by adding a border and fill, the designer makes each individual pizza on the “Browse Zia’s Pizza” screen function more like a content card. This style of border and fill shows users they can click on a pizza to find out more about it and add it to their order. 

## **Step 6: Review your negative space**

Does your mockup use negative space to:

- Make the product easy to read?
    
- Enhance the product’s visual appeal?
    

For comparison, notice the different amounts of white space in the two versions of the “Browse Zia’s Pizza” screen below. In the left-hand version, the elements are too cramped to read and use with ease. In the right-hand screen, the extra white space makes it easier for users to read the text, navigate the buttons, and understand the information hierarchy.

## **Step 7: Review your design’s overall consistency**

Are all your design’s visual elements consistent across the included screens? Do those elements work well together to create a usable, meaningful, and consistent user experience?

## **Step 8: Reflect on your process**

Be sure you’ve assessed the following elements in your completed deliverable. Your mockups should use:

- Typography to create hierarchy and promote readability
    
- Color to add emphasis, variety, and accessibility
    
- Icons to save space and guide easy navigation
    
- Containment to separate sections and create neat organization
    
- Negative space to promote readability and visual appeal
    
- All visual elements to showcase consistency and promote the brand
    

## **Step 9: Save your work**

As you complete these activities, remember to: 

1. Take photos of your progress and save them. These can include progress photos of sketches, photos of different stages of the activity, pictures of brainstorming sessions, and even photos of you working. 
    
2. Save all of your work to your computer, a hard drive, or a Google Drive folder to make sure you have all the resources you'll need later in the certificate to add to your portfolio.
