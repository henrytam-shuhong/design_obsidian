# Revise project mockups by adding negative space

You’ve learned about using negative space to add emphasis, readability, and clear grouping to your design. This review will demonstrate how a designer used negative space to improve the Zia’s Pizza app.

## **Evaluate negative space in current design**

Figma canvas with a high-fidelity mockup of Zia’s Pizza app illustrating a design that is crowded and has readability issues.

As you’ve learned, any space that doesn’t have an element in it is negative space. In this example, the designer started by evaluating the negative space in the mockup and had these observations:

- The content is tightly packed.
    
- It’s hard to read and overwhelming.
    
- The content sections are too close together.
    
- The customization options are tightly squeezed together.
    
- There are too many sections on the page to be easily usable. 
    

## **Determine how to improve the design’s spacing**

Once the evaluation was complete, the designer determined specific ways to  use negative space to improve the grouping, emphasis, and readability. 

## **Grouping** 

![Close-up image of the “Browse Zia’s Pizzas” section illustrating cards that are too close together.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/0yC7YbRgSKy9nsfy4kpH8w_db7afd9cb19a493c95517e880d2349f1_iAe5TO1NnAgRfnNEPOXURXTZAHE4gy1OpGYQaF30e5QLKdXPWZxFIC32r1fKZIEPgfuOCAvXFecHeUBdBOjPYSRkRTQMHhlPjlYFbKYvR9L14d8Xo4vvVnO_Qk6ZYA9wJ7n_bxsv8jWhv2DuzKu0Zv27W3q9y7c-GZcHI_7iZ_jQdGeqn6UPGmgeWCWuGVai2hwysXaD3Nbqm3Dy4Z-O22L2IgRfjvpTOnGKjA?expiry=1746057600000&hmac=gpsRPLW-q3o86ypyCPRJlm77MdbgAl8qrFVqAO8GDIM)

This before image shows that the cards were too close together to be easily usable, so the designer decided to add more negative space around the cards. This reinforces the Gestalt principle of proximity and, in this case, will make the hierarchy of the cards simple to comprehend.

## **Emphasis**

This before image shows how close the customization buttons were, making them hard to interact with. The designer determined that adding negative space around the customization buttons would help emphasize the actions that the user needs to take. 

## **Readability**

This before image shows that the text was hard to read, so the designer decided more negative space is needed between the content sections to help improve readability. 

## **Refine the design’s negative space**

Left mockup is more crowded with less negative space, and the elements run together. Right mockup has more negative space, and it is clear where the sections are.

## **Before and after**

The designer implemented the changes as seen in the image on the right. Note the following improvements: 

- **Grouping:** The user can better tell which elements are grouped together, and which aren’t, because of the use of additional negative space.
    
- **Emphasis:** The spacing between the different types of pizza is clear, and the ingredient sections are separated enough to be distinct and easy to interact with. 
    
- **Readability:** Everything is clearly separated and defined appropriately using the space between sections and elements. 
    

As you can see, the amount of space between and around the elements plays a big part in the usability. Once the designer made the improvements and adjustments to this one screen, then they repeated the process for all of the mockup screens.

## **Improve your portfolio by addressing negative space**

When you’re ready, you can use this example as a guide to review and revise your own portfolio projects in terms of negative space. Remember, you want to aim for 3–5 completed projects for your portfolio. Keep iterating and improving along the way!

Thinking of the three primary strengths of negative space listed above, you can experiment with your layout to make your design easier to use. Remember that any previous decisions aren’t locked in. If you need to make adjustments to previous decisions like color or text, that is fine. 

## **Key takeaways**

Use negative space to add emphasis, improve readability, and create clear groupings in your own portfolio project mockups.

- Start by identifying the places where there is not enough negative space.
    
- Determine places to use negative space to improve the grouping, emphasis, and readability.
    
- Implement the changes in one screen first, and then repeat on all other screens.
