### **Using Grids in UX Design: Enhancing Layout & Visual Structure**

Grids are a fundamental tool in UX design that **improve clarity, consistency, and collaboration** while making mockups **easier to navigate**.

---

### **1. Types of Grids**
âœ… **Basic Grids:**  
- Intersecting **lines dividing pages into squares**.  
- Useful for **spacing elements evenly**.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Similar to wireframes drawn on **grid paper**.

âœ… **Layout Grids:**  
- Consist of **columns and alleys** (spaces between columns).  
- Help organize **text, images, and UI components**.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A **12-column grid** for a desktop screen, whereas smaller screens might use **4-8 columns**.

### **2. Why Use Grids?**
âœ… **Creates Clarity & Consistency:** Helps **guide the eye** and makes scanning easier.  
âœ… **Speeds Up Design:** Provides **structured placement** of elements.  
âœ… **Improves Collaboration:** Teams can align designs **without confusion** about element positioning.  

ðŸ’¡ **Example:** In the **Peacock app mockup**, the grid ensured **equal image sizing** and centered search bars.

### **3. Applying Grids in UX Projects**
ðŸ”¹ Choose **basic grids** for simple designs or **layout grids** for structured mockups.  
ðŸ”¹ Adjust **columns based on screen size** (e.g., fewer columns for mobile screens).  
ðŸ”¹ Use grids to **reuse successful layouts** across different projects.  

ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** A **food ordering app** could borrow the same **grid structure** used in a **social platform mockup**.
