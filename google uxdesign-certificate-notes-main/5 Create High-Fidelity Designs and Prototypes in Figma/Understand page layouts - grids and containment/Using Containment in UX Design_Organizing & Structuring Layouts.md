Containment ensures **designs remain neat and structured** by using **visual barriers** to separate elements effectively. This helps users navigate content seamlessly.

### **1. Four Methods of Containment**
âœ… **Dividers:**  
- Simple lines that **separate sections** of content.  
- Helps users scan and **identify information quickly**.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** In the **dog walker app**, a **gray divider** is used to split listings of available walkers.

âœ… **Borders:**  
- Continuous lines **surrounding an element**, enhancing visibility.  
- Defines clickable elements like **buttons**.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Adding a rectangular **border** around the **choose-a-time button** ensures itâ€™s recognizable as an interactive element.

âœ… **Fill:**  
- Assigns **color to objects** to increase emphasis and contrast.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** The **choose-a-time button** uses **an orange fill** to stand out and direct attention.

âœ… **Shadow:**  
- Creates **depth and dimension**, making elements more visually engaging.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** A shadow effect on the **choose-a-time button** gives it a **three-dimensional appearance**, making it feel elevated from the background.
