You’re almost ready to create your very first mockup in Figma. Before you get started, let’s explore some of the skills that will give you the basic foundation to confidently create mockups in Figma. 

- Create a new **page.**
    
- Create frames on the **canvas.**
    
- Tab between projects in Figma.
    

## **Names to know**

Before you can begin creating a mockup, it’s important to understand the names that are used in Figma.

- Each document is called a **file**. 
    
- A **file** contains the **canvas,** where you’ll create layers and objects for your designs. 
    
- A **file** also contains **pages**, where you’ll design your screens. 
    
- Each **page** has its own **canvas.** This **canvas** is gray (#E5E5E5) by default and is where you can add, remove, and update your designs. 
    

## **Create a new page**

It’s easy to create a new page in Figma by following these simple steps:

1. Log in to Figma.
    
2. Create a new **Design file** by clicking the + icon in the upper-right corner.
    
3. On the left, click **Page 1**. This lists all of the pages currently in your **file.**
    
4. Click the + icon to add a new **page** to your file, as shown in the image below. 
    
5. When you create a new **page,** you’ll immediately be able to rename it. Or, you can rename a page at any time by double-clicking the title of the **page.** When you begin to name a page, the name text will be highlighted in blue and the row will be outlined in blue, as shown in the image below.

that goes through detailed steps to create a **page**, duplicate a **page**, view all of your **pages**, and more.

## **Create frames**

The **canvas** in Figma is where you’ll create **frames.** You can think of the **canvas** like a blank wall that a picture frame hangs on, and the **frames** are like picture frames where you’ll design.

To create a new **frame:** Select the **frame** tool. The icon has four lines crossing in a grid pattern. It’s listed as the third icon from the left in the toolbar. The image below shows the frame icon in the Figma toolbar.

There are a few ways to choose the size of the frame:

1. Click inside the **canvas** to create a default **frame.** The dimensions for default frames are 100x100 pixels. 
    
2. Click and drag in the **canvas** to create a **frame** with the dimensions you prefer. When you click and drag, the width and height will automatically update based on how much you drag. If you want to choose a specific width and height, you can do this in the **frame** section in the **design** panel on the right side of the screen.
    
3. Select a predetermined size for a frame, like a specific phone model or tablet, in the **Design** panel on the right side of the screen. As shown in the image below, there is a list of different containers or **frames** for various devices or formats. Simply select a size to add the **frame** to your **canvas.**

## **You have the tools!**

You’ll use Figma or a similar design tool in your job as a UX designer. The more familiar you become with Figma and its features, the faster you’ll be able to create your own digital mockups in any tool. Remember: The knowledge you’re gaining isn’t limited to Figma. The skills you’re acquiring by working in Figma will transfer to your work in other digital tools.

Before you get to work, here’s a pro tip: It helps to open multiple windows to view your files. With multiple windows open, you can view a different file from the one you’re working in without closing your current file. To create a new window, right-click files in your "Drafts” and “Recents" folders, and select “Open in new tab.”
