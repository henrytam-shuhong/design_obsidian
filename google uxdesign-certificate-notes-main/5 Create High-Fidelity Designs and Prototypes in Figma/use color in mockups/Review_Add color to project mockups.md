You’ve learned how designers use color to add emphasis, create variety, promote accessibility, and communicate branding in their designs. Like typography, color is another powerful design element you can use to make your designs more usable and meaningful. As you move forward with designing your portfolio project mockups, let’s revisit the Zia’s Pizza example and explore how the designer applied color to enhance users’ experience with the app.

## **A defined color palette**

Before considering the app screen mockups, notice the **color palette** of bright red, dark green, pastel red, and pastel green. The designer used Figma’s color picker tool to define that palette and arrange each color in a frame. (See this reading for a refresher on how to [work with color in mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/MDi11/work-with-color-in-mockups)

.) A predefined color palette helps with both design efficiency and visual consistency: The designer can refer to their palette to quickly identify the hex codes they need for adding color to new design elements, and they can ensure they’re consistently using the same colors across parallel elements, like buttons and headers.

Importantly, this color palette sets the designer up to satisfy the 60-30-10 rule, a best practice for selecting colors:

- One neutral color makes up 60% of the color palette.
    
- One complementary color makes up 30% of the palette.
    
- One accent color makes up 10% of the palette.
    

From the palette they’ve defined, the designer for Zia’s Pizza can use white or some other neutral, like light gray, as the neutral color for 60% of their design. The pastel red and pastel green can serve as the complementary colors for 30% of the design. And the bright red and dark green can serve as accents for the other 10% of the design.

Now let’s explore how the designer applied this palette to their app mockup.

## **The color palette in action**

First, the designer used the bright red accent (E81A3F) to create **emphasis**. It draws attention to the buttons so users can easily see where they need to take action. That same eye-catching red also emphasizes important information, like the pickup wait time and the description of “The Glorious” pizza of the day.

Second, the designer uses color to create both visual **variety** and high visual contrast, which is key to **accessibility**. Red and green are complementary colors that make one another appear more vibrant. In their pastel forms, they appear alongside the app’s neutral white to create mild visual contrast and offer good backgrounds where more important colors can stand out. Crucially, both the white and the pastels provide contrast for the dark gray of the headers and body text. This contrast makes the app easier to read and will help it pass WCAG accessibility standards.

.) 

Finally, the designer used their color palette in a consistent way to communicate the product’s **brand**. Recall the color of the Zia’s Pizza logo in the mockups from the reading about [adding typography to mockups](https://www.coursera.org/learn/high-fidelity-designs-prototype/supplement/YKA8k/add-product-copy-to-mockups)

. That logo appears in the same bright red color that the designer uses to emphasize the app’s buttons. This kind of consistency links the client’s brand name, “Zia’s Pizza,” with the key actions that users want to take as they engage with the brand, mainly building and placing pizza orders.

As you build your design skills and learn more about color, consider the kinds of **messages** it sends to users. In some cultures, for example, red is powerfully associated with food, appetite, and eating, which is why it often appears in the visual elements of major food brands like McDonald’s and Coca-Cola. In the example, then, it may be no coincidence that the designer chooses to feature a bright red for the logo and key buttons.

As you add color to your own mockups, remember to pay attention to your prior color decisions and ensure consistency across the design. As with all parts of the design process, your color choices aren’t locked in: You should iterate and update as needed. But if you do update your color choices, be sure to update your main palette so that the key reference is always current.

## **Key takeaways**

Are you ready to start filling your mockups with color? This is an exciting point in your design process because, like typography, color is a key element for bringing your designs to life and creating experiences that users will find easy and enjoyable. Remember to use color thoughtfully throughout your project portfolio, where you’re aiming for 3–5 completed design projects.
