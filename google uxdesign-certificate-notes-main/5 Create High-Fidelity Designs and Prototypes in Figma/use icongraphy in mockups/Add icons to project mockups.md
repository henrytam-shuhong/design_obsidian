You’ve learned that **icons** are images or symbols that stand for specific actions or tools in an app or website. When used effectively, icons:

- Save space
    
- Catch the user's attention
    
- Transition users to new information or new locations in the product
    
- Showcase the product’s brand
    
- Improve accessibility by helping overcome language barriers
    

For example, consider these two mockups of the navigation panel in the Zia’s Pizza app: a lo-fi mockup without icons and a hi-fi mockup with icons.

By adding the icons on the right, the designer has enhanced the app’s navigation, saved space, and made the design more engaging and accessible. In this review, you’ll explore how the designer added and edited these icons in their mockup.

## **Determine where to include icons**

When determining where to include icons, designers typically focus on a product’s user flow and identify places where icons might guide and support users. In your own mockups, you might begin by identifying 2–3 places to include icons. 

Depending on the needs of your specific design, this may include:

- Home menu icons
    
- Contact icons
    
- Settings icons
    

It may also include icons in a navigation menu, like those in the example above.

You’ve probably interacted with icons like these in the websites and apps you use every day. Think about ways that such icons help designs:

- Save space by condensing words into visuals
    
- Catch the user's attention with imagery
    
- Make it easier to transition to another page or location
    

In the Zia’s pizza app, for example, the classic house icon condenses the “Home” menu item into an easily recognizable visual, which is made especially interesting by the design’s bright red color. Even a user who doesn’t understand the word “home” may recognize that icon and use it to easily navigate to the app’s home screen.

## **Design or import effective icons** 

Once a designer has decided where to include icons, it’s time to get those icons into the design. Figma enables designers to import, create, adjust, and save icons within the application itself. Designers can even import open-source icons by using this [free Material Design plugin for Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/740272380439725040/Material-Design-Icons)

. If they need or are inspired to create custom icons, they can design them from scratch. 

**Pro tip**: If you choose to design icons from scratch, consider the design principles discussed on the [Material Design website](https://material.io/design/iconography/system-icons.html#design-principles)

.

Whichever way designers choose to bring icons into a design, they typically consider these essential guiding questions:

**Will this icon be inclusive and accessible for users?** Think about whether an icon will communicate what you want it to communicate to all users. For example, if its meaning is unique to a specific culture, or if it has multiple meanings across different locations, it may not be inclusive or accessible.

**Have I added an alt-text label to describe what the icon means?** Screen readers cannot read icons, but they will read the alt-text labels attached to those icons. Alt-text labels are essential for making icons accessible. 

**Have I chosen iconography that represents the company’s brand and meets any relevant branding guidelines?** Like all visual elements of a design, icons can convey a brand’s identity, mission, and values.

In the Zia’s Pizza app, for example, the designer chose and designed their icons to maximize accessibility and branding:

![High-fidelity mockup of navigation menu with icons for menu items:](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/cZ3E5B_gT2iTQz6afoQzAg_47ec2fde0f2841d0aa60a350f3adddf1_gRFu-37STn_7O9eSRtFMUiQLI3FsQpEphUSOp9F1517PfcXqhDIlBxamOpyR-YVcY1ggD6XvAcHxH58UUeUlWcVFM7l4g-RmKi-f3kGsFXBXoVvmhM82im1IIJ9kNGWkickdi3nHU32cuX4mHo29t8o?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=1birdJQzyji_rWhPmyuYsUoO9wKXy_CBftEhNRZngCM)

High-fidelity mockup of navigation menu with icons for menu items: house icon for Home, plus icon for Build Your Own, pizza slice icon for Browse Pizzas, heart icon for Saved, person icon for Profile, question mark icon for Help.

Most of these icons are industry-standard icons that designers use for similar purposes across many kinds of products, such as the house icon for “Home” and the heart icon for “Saved.” Regardless of their location, culture, or background, many users will immediately recognize these common icons and understand exactly what they mean.

There’s also an icon that’s more specific to the app: the pizza icon for “Browse Pizzas.” While this icon is specific to the app, it’s not unusual or obscure. It clearly captures the information that users will get from the “Browse Pizzas” screen, and it also represents Zia’s brand.

There isn’t necessarily an industry-standard icon associated with the “Build Your Own” screen, like the question mark icon for “Help,” so the designer opted for a simple plus sign icon. This icon may work, but the designer should validate it during usability testing. Some users may associate the plus sign with something besides building a food order.

With the possible exception of the plus icon, all these icons make it easier for users to navigate the product: Each one clearly signals where it will take users. They’re also interesting and coherently branded: Their bright red color is one of the app’s accent colors, and it links the icons with the “Zia’s” logo at the top of the menu.

These icons are all freely available from the [**Material Design**](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline)

icon set. For a prototype, it’s a good idea to check and see what’s available before taking time to create something new.

## **Add and edit icons in designs**

To add and edit icons in Figma, the icon files must be in svg format. Once you have saved your icon file or downloaded an open-source icon to your computer, those icons can be added to a mockup.  

When you’re ready to add icons to your mockups, here are instructions:

First, in your Figma canvas, go to the toolbar at the top of the canvas and look for the **Shape tools** option: Tt’s the rectangle icon. Select the rectangle icon and select **Place image/video** from the drop-down menu.

**Note:** Figma is launching their new interface UI3 this year. Updates will be released on a rolling basis— some users may already have the new UI! In order to help users transition, Figma has created a resource for [Navigating UI3: Figma’s New UI](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/23954856027159-Navigating-UI3-Figma-s-new-UI)

. This article catalogs what changes have been made, where features have been moved, and even a quick guide for users who want to revert back to UI2 for the time being. 

![graphical user interface, text, application, chat or text message](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/_1e8f0ff7d93d46729a760be80080d8f1_Screenshot-2025-02-25-12.59.13-PM-1.png?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=FWOnvcon9-a1G4gjVupwApPKBHFzA5UTpUbszGGrA5U)

Second, when prompted, find the icon file you want to insert and click **Open.**

![Computer window showing an icon file and Open button.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ndddAslmSbu9k5tsYHFkqg_f32f490bfc8b46febee687ccb76e9ff1_nlGTaAlo1tZ8KsVTMGrEIm0dFgdbM7x8AazFDW0qauCALiGBIZfJW9MwX-QcN2eumz4xO4CLtXcywpJEdyYLn_dsymtL0myb8vVh9Mp-qM7fKhZ1UBb99AWMRQhlI_6pQjQjm8xad2yhFQWL-cPR8o8?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=AigK9Zrvn98iPnVMpCzZPULCUUo6qPlkHeTb5NIhUOs)

Third, click on the spot in your canvas where you want to place the icon. You can also drag the icon into place after it appears.

Fourth, adjust the size of your icon: Select the icon that you want to adjust, and hold the **Shift** button as you drag the corner. Holding **Shift** constrains the proportions of your icon, keeping the height and width consistent.

![House icon with a proportion label](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/AIAKJ9GlRTqVnrCrMk8_bw_98d8e7eb38ff457d8a3c393a1d1e41f1_6AETbc4Pd2glp9R1TR4e5xX35pfvHvIwlHYgeARqnHQOVzRKThdL1gD4-E8g5b3_w1uHniAcAuz4D2OxqSvY2FpYbB2Y1TFbXCOSfxTY7mXmWwTQ-u2NFeJND8K--uSDNwUmXV46AthRkVEOb3_97i0?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=FIdNi3kg5zPzvbrkxhnLfDvX-FzgIWMVqHjldMme2m0)

To adjust the height or width with your keyboard instead of your mouse, select your icon, go to the **Design tab** in the right sidebar, and then make your adjustments.

Fifth, adjust the color of your icon to make it consistent with the color palette you created for your design.

![Close up on a navigation menu with the House icon selected.

Lastly, and if applicable, add a text box under the icon and add a label describing what the icon means. Format your icon labels to be consistent with your prior typographical choices.

## **Set and save icon types to a library**

In Figma, designers can reuse components across their files and projects and publish them to a team library. If you want to take this step in your own work, here are instructions:

Select an icon and create a component using the **Create a component** button in the center of the top toolbar: It’s the four squares arranged in a diamond shape.

![House icon and top toolbar in Figma canvas. In the toolbar, the Create a component button is highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5wPUbdOiSt-7bGQP_PcJ4w_0450032d23ac438e9b11b1dafd547af1_oDusfF-AJcRfkshhHDpoG0nWXeGAp6CZsCi0d1tLb9GpdWhqicOdiWkBbJ2G4828a7fZ9gRw-iNQddsddzYidVlbmE46L6v266tYyYcUje7dmiu1ROb55qqnnaq5HiOwsBsg6vISn2M4urNvIdmB3mY?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=aNoBAie1A_-GvCXXRZDw8il3sHic1iUMbDeavplsiZ4)

If you’re working alone, this component will be saved and accessible through the **Local components** section of the **Assets** panel.

![Figma Assets panel with Local components section open. In the Local components section, a House icon is highlighted.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/wb4wnQvYSfaIIk2i9EjtcA_6db8b77f886d4ced98876f36811424f1_7CmCfByTVWu1zZogtEyN5DpCCCInV0iZ--hFiMD-qN6ZkIaU_YRrULxkdOOl7Xf-OVqgCCPeXmblH32cQFHGg5nLoyrt2dPrtDdkhlog-AmjfON3vfkJlQJQB1p7srWWjoDcLgK7x0XNdbVCGXmJ6fM?expiry=1745366400000&hmac=JDVQr-hRoimTlbQFJgsIrVQgUg56vI8aI9Vrgl1bZ2Q)

Eventually, when you’re working on a team, you will publish your icons to your team library so they can be accessed through you and your team’s **Assets** panel whenever you need them. A shared library helps teams maintain a consistent brand and style at scale. 

## **Populate mockups with icons**

Once designers define and save the icons they want to use, they can start implementing those icons in the rest of their design. But they don’t necessarily stay locked into their initial icon choices. As they continue to work, designers often adjust and change icon selections for a variety of reasons. When you iterate this way in your own designs, feel free to go back and revise, and always make sure to update out-of-date icons to be consistent with later design choices.

## **Reflect on icons** 

As they iterate their designs, effective designers periodically pause to reflect on their choices and make improvements for users. When it comes to icons, here are some useful reflection questions you can ask yourself:

- Will these icons guide and support users by saving space, catching attention, and making it easier to transition to another page or location?
    
- Are there alt-text labels to describe what the icons mean and make them accessible for screen readers?
    
- Have I ensured the icons are not too specific to a particular culture or geographic location?
    
- Are the icons and labels consistent with the color palette and typography I’ve established in my design? 
    
- Is the iconography consistent with relevant branding and style guidelines?
    

## **Key takeaways**

Now you’re ready to add icons to your own project portfolio designs! This is another exciting moment in the creation of your hi-fi mockups because icons are a powerful tool for making designs more usable and meaningful. They help designs to save space, get users’ attention, transition users to new locations, and convey the product’s brand. As you apply icons to your project portfolio, remember that you’re aiming for a portfolio with 3–5 completed design projects.
