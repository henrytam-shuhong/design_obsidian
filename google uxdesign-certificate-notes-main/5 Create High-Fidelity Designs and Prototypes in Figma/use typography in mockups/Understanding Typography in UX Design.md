Typography plays a crucial role in **visual design**, helping create hierarchy, readability, and style. Choosing the right typography involves three steps: **type classification, typeface selection, and font choice**.

---

### **1. Type Classification (Serif vs. Sans Serif)**
âœ… **Serif Typefaces:** Recognizable by **tiny lines (serifs) extending from letters**.  
ðŸ’¡ **Examples:** Times New Roman, Georgia, Cambria.  

âœ… **Sans Serif Typefaces:** **No extra lines**â€”clean, modern appearance.  
ðŸ’¡ **Examples:** Arial, Helvetica, Verdana.  

Historically, **sans serif fonts** were preferred in UX design for better screen readability, but **modern technology has improved serif readability**, leading to their resurgence.

### **2. Typeface Selection (Family Styles)**
âœ… **What It Is:** The **overall letter styling**, including **stroke weight, shape, and line length**.  
âœ… **Why It Matters:** Defines **visual tone** and **personality** within a design.  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Roboto, a popular sans-serif typeface, has multiple variations.

---

### **3. Font Choice (Size, Weight & Emphasis)**
âœ… **What It Is:** A **specific style within a typeface** (e.g., bold, italic, light).  
ðŸ’¡ **Example:** Roboto Bold 12pt vs. Roboto Light 18ptâ€”same typeface, different font styles.
