## User flows

Path taken by a typical user so they can complete a task from start to finish.

Shapes (same as typical flow chart):

- Circle: Action
- Rectangle: Screen
- Diamond: Decision
- Lines: Direction

## Storyboard

A series of panels / frames that visually describe and explore a user's experience with a product.

4 elements:

- Character: The user
- Scene: User's environment
- Plot: Benefit or solution of design
- Narrative: The user's need or problem and how the design solves it

Two types:

- Big picture: Focuses on the user experience, how product will be used throughout the day, why it's useful, etc. "How & why".
- Close-up: Focuses on the product itself, what happens on screens, transitions, flow. "What".

Typically, you want big picture for early on, to get buy in, overall experience. Later on, you'll want close-up to get details within the app.

## Wireframes

Why:

- Establish basic structure of a page
- Highlight the intended function of the product

Benefits:

- Inform the elements that should be included
- Help catch problems early
- Get stakeholders to focus on structure not actual details
- Save time & effort since everyone is roughly in sync from the start
- Can iterate quickly

Common standards:

- Text: Horizontal lines
- Images / icons: Circle with x in
- CTA: Rectangle / circle
