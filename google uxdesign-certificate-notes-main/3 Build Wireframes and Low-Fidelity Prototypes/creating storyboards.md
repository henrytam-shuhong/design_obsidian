In UX design, a **storyboard** is a series of panels or frames that visually describes and explores a user’s experience with a product. Telling a story through visuals is often more effective than using words. 

A real product might have many screens, but your storyboard should focus on just the most important parts of a user’s experience with a product. As their name suggests, there’s a _story_ that should be told through the panels of a storyboard. The four key elements of a storyboard are:

- **Character**: States the user in the storyboard.
    
- **Scene**: Gives designers a way to imagine the user’s environment.
    
- **Plot**: Describes the solution or benefit offered by the design.
    
- **Narrative**: Describes the problem the user is facing and how the design will solve this problem.
    

There are two common types of storyboards in UX design, both of which incorporate these four key elements:

- **Big-picture storyboards** focus on what the _user_ needs, their context, and why the product will be useful to the user. Big-picture storyboards are often used early in the design process when designers are trying to get stakeholders to support their ideas.
    
- **Close-up storyboards** concentrate on the _product_ and how it works. They’re best used in the middle to the end of the design process.
    

Let’s explore how we can create each of these storyboards with a real example. Imagine this scenario: You’re designing an app called Bandmate for musicians to recruit talented band members. A user that might come to your app for help is a guitarist in a rock band. We’ll call them Dan. Their band’s drummer suddenly quit, so Dan needs to find a new drummer.

## Create a big-picture storyboard

**1. Start with a problem statement.** This will help establish character and set the scene for your storyboard. 

For this example, the problem statement might be: 

![Dan problem statement](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/BygZZJK4QseoGWSSuFLHPw_0753f42381d64e94add65eb20b0685e4_Screenshot-2021-03-04-at-10.53.39-AM.png?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=fHf4mUh6RhkBQW34VHaoC_oaaWFwAS4fWjilGEKOv7c)

Dan is a lead guitarist in a band who needs to hire a new drummer because they are having issues replacing the previous drummer.

_Dan is a lead guitarist in a band who needs to hire a new drummer because they are having issues replacing the previous drummer._ 

**2. Create a goal statement**. Your goal statement helps you determine a _plot_ (the benefit or solution of your design) for your storyboard. 

A goal statement for this example might be: 

![Goal statement - Bandmate app](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/MmS3xQOwTPqkt8UDsCz6YQ_760421dff74a4171b0fb6ec826c4e94a_Screen-Shot-2021-03-05-at-11.25.59-PM.png?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=RvtBqub7voZNDUh_fYoA2KecQWmyjChA1hFt7kaMqAw)

Our bandmate app will let users recruit new substitute musicians which will affect users who need new ban members by letting them easily find qualified musicians to hire. We will measure effectiveness by reading user reviews and tracking successful hires.

![At the top, there's a place to describe the scenario. On the template there are spaces for images and description of action.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/ij9ULMjzSDC_VCzI81gwQw_4b6dd89883284f05b8361b49ac1a75ea_Screen-Shot-2021-01-09-at-2.25.04-AM.png?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=vPk6c4mpCXoyCQHTcXJ4rn9CgaVhnT8mhot75Sj3T5g)

The storyboard template. At the top of the page, there's a place to describe the scenario. On the template itself there are spaces for images and descriptions of action.

**4. Add the storyboard scenario.** Begin filling out the storyboard template by adding the scenario. At the top of the template, write a sentence that sets the narrative for the storyboard. Thinking back to the problem from the problem statement and the solution from the goal statement, write a short, clear sentence that describes the user and the problem your design solves for them. Consider the end result that will solve the user’s problem.

For this example, you want the Bandmate app to help Dan find a new drummer for their band. So the scenario at the top of the storyboard might be:

_An app that allows users to recruit qualified, new, or substitute musicians to join their band._

**5. Draw one idea per panel.** The first panel is used to set the scene for the story. Then with each additional panel, think about actions that push the story forward and how the _user_ feels in each panel.

In the first panel, what is the event that triggers Dan to find a new drummer? In this case, Dan’s drummer quit, so he needs to find a replacement drummer to join the band.

In the second panel, Dan finds and opens an app that can help him recruit qualified, new, or substitute musicians that are located in his local area. This action should be drawn in its own panel. 

In the third panel, Dan finds an experienced drummer who lives nearby while scrolling through the app. He filters for drummers with at least five years of experience in a professional band, who have good reviews, and who live within 30 miles of his current location. 

**Pro tip: Remember that big-picture storyboards focus on the user experience**. The storyboard should show how people use your product and why your product will be helpful to them. Because big-picture storyboards are about the user, it's important to include emotion by using a sad or happy face, for example, at different steps of the journey to make the storyboard feel human and relatable. 

**6. Expose pain points for the user along their journey**. Dan had a bad experience in the past when he hired a keyboard player for the band who turned out to be unqualified. While using this new app, Dan needs to be able to identify qualifications from the musician’s profile, like how many years they’ve played in a band or the ratings they’ve received from other users. Dan might feel a little nervous because of his past bad experiences finding bandmates. This is drawn in the fourth panel.

Then, in the fifth panel, Dan selects a drummer in the app and taps the “schedule” button to set up an interview with the potential replacement drummer. 

**7. Include the user goal or conclusion in the final panel.** In this example, the conclusion is that a new drummer joins the band. Dan is very happy, and his band schedules several gigs. Make sure to include an emotion to demonstrate how the user feels at the end of the experience with your product. In this case, Dan feels excited and satisfied. 

And that’s it! Check out the completed big-picture storyboard for this example:

![big picture UX design storyboard: Bandmate](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/FvpfiWrgSHC6X4lq4Khw9A_71cbf1ab2e574f78bf068408982c2d17_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-10.36.29-PM.png?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=Xt9tfaS3B2-5W8MbR6q8c4dKxWLl7Mo2r-kpbuOPp10)

Scenario: An app that allows users to recruit qualifies, new, or substitute musicians to join their band. 1. The drummer in Dan's band quite so he needs to find a replacement. 2. Dan finds and opens the app. 3. Dan scrolls through the app and finds an experienced drummer who lives nearby. 4. A former band member did not have experience with rock music so having relevant experience is important. 5. Dan selects a drummer and taps submit to schedule an interview. 6. Dan is happy and his band schedules several gigs.

You brought the user, Dan, on a journey to find a new drummer for his band. You’ve addressed his pain points and helped him find a qualified drummer. Your user is delighted with the app experience. Big-picture storyboards can really help immerse you in the experience of a user, which leads to better products overall.

## Create a close-up storyboard

To create a close-up storyboard, steps 1-4 are the same as the big-picture storyboard process:

1. Start with a problem statement. 
    
2. Create a goal statement. 
    
3. Set up the storyboard.
    
4. Add the storyboard scenario.
    

**5. Draw one idea per panel.** Big-picture storyboards and close-up storyboards differ in step five, when you draw each panel. Remember, big-picture storyboards focus on the _user_, while close-up storyboards focus on the _product_. For this close-up storyboard, think about which product details you want to draw attention to on each panel and why. You want to demonstrate the user flow within the product and how each action within the product will lead to the next screen. 

- To begin, in the **first panel**, the user will open their phone, swipe through their apps, and tap the icon for the musician app to open it. 
    
- Oftentimes when designing an app, one panel of a close-up storyboard will focus on how a user begins their journey when they first open the app. For this example of the app to find musicians, let’s imagine that a new user can create a profile or an existing user can log in. This is shown in the **second panel**. 
    
- In the **third panel**, once the user is logged into the app, they can begin searching for their bandmate. The user scrolls through profiles of musicians and can set filters like level of experience, years played, location, instruments played, and more. 
    
- In the **fourth panel**, the user taps the “view profile” button of one of the musicians to review their experience, qualifications, and location. 
    
- Then, once the user finds a candidate they’re interested in contacting, they tap the “submit” button to send a message to that musician. The user can write their own message or send an automated message that asks about availability and to schedule a conversation. There’s also an option for the user to provide a sample of their music to the musician. This is shown in the **fifth panel**. 
    
- Finally, in the **sixth panel,** the user receives a confirmation that their message has been sent and a description of the next steps to expect. The text below the confirmation might say something like, “Your message to this musician has been sent.” There will also be a button linking back to the user’s inbox and one that leads them back to the search page they just came from. 
    

Check out the completed close-up storyboard for this example:

![close up UX design storyboard: Bandmate](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/B3BWZlPqSyKwVmZT6ssifw_ef8999d26f5c4b0693de12a5fe1faf4a_Screenshot-2021-03-05-at-10.36.08-PM.png?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=6GEr0G6GrKHfpdtZqi-Txf5MAEsMQzDYOZzXrrjorUY)

Scenario: An app that allows users to recruit qualifies, new, or substitute musicians to join their band. 1. user finds musician app and tapes the icon to open the app 2. new user create profile or existing user logs in 3. user scrolls through musician profiles to search for qualified candidates and sets filters. 4. user selects "view profile" to review musician's experience, qualifications, location, etc. 5. user selects the "submit" button to send a message to a specific musician 6. user receives confirmation that message was sent and expected next steps.

That’s it! You now know how to create a big-picture and a close-up storyboard. In the next activity, you’ll have an opportunity to create your own storyboards. Have fun!

# Create project storyboards

## **Introduction**

You just learned about user flows, how to create storyboards, and the two different types of storyboards. As a reminder, the four key elements of a storyboard are:

- Character
    
- Scene
    
- Plot
    
- Narrative
    

The **character** in your storyboard is the user your story is about. The **scene** helps you imagine this user’s environment. The **plot** describes the benefit or solution of your design. Finally, the **narrative** describes the user’s need or problem and how the design will solve the problem.

Now you’ll review how a designer created a big-picture and close-up storyboard for the CoffeeHouse app.

## **Big-picture storyboard**

Like a good movie, **a big-picture storyboard** can show the emotional engagement that a user will have with an app or product. Understanding how a user feels while experiencing a product is an essential part of the design process.

As a reminder, big-picture storyboards include sketches that:

- Focus on the user
    
- Indicate the environment or context where the user is located
    
- Focus on the specific need or pain point experienced by the user
    

Now, let’s review how the CoffeeHouse app designer approached big-picture storyboarding, starting with the essential elements of a storyboard: the problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement.

1. **Problem statement** The designer used the same problem statement for both the big-picture storyboard and close-up storyboard: _**Anika**_ _is a busy marketing intern_ _**who needs**_ _a faster, more collaborative way to take many coffee orders at once_ _**because**_ _taking individual orders takes too long._ This problem statement gave the designer a good idea of a character for the story: Anika, a busy marketing intern. It also sets the scene for the storyboards: Anika is entering a large coffee order and picking it up for her office. 
    
2. **Goal statement** Next, the designer considered the goal statement they had created based on the problem statement: _The CoffeeHouse app will let users place group orders in advance, which will affect users who have to make and pick up large orders by letting users skip the in-store order line and saving them time. We will measure effectiveness by tracking orders of 5+ items placed through the app._ This helps set the plot for the story, which will be about a customer successfully placing a large coffee order quickly and easily.
    
3. **Scenario statement** The scenario statement describes the narrative that the storyboards depict. This  storyboard tells the story of how the app helps a user submit a large coffee order for pick-up at their local CoffeeHouse shop. The scenario statement is: _An app to help users place large coffee orders quickly and easily._
    

Based on these elements, the designer created a big-picture storyboard.

![Big-picture storyboard showing six panels.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/WJCgeVwdTl6O2Ukal8tlNg_09b656c678ca443ba83d716cf4e730f1_FZfxQE0ij69iwBgSv8bjHhMaQ_qznTINXU2980UrgRpy13D54gO7qm36CU7HnIG31tgkCtUWGpykbpeA53eB6LIlo1Q6QDuVtIO1dh2GvmR7zJFDzTi7ArBx7jo3jC0Uai4numGz02Ih8sfktelXrFe2JARhu0DXXTt5-UTubNuPOhQ-C8NGU78RqImBICjIRIhL62bTvT7nrN3k2a3ntUBxj3NUnfoTY-cMNA?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=8m_5J2ZtTskqhvwltmFazI_rfsFTI5aP5GkIP5lTWYA)

Panel 1: Anika wants to get coffee for the team. Anika's surrounded by people giving orders at the coffee shop; Panel 2: Anika remembers that an app can help out in this situation; Panel 3: Anika decides to use the CoffeeHouse app to take orders for her team; Panel 4: Anika learns that they can send the menu of items to the team within the app so the team can place their own orders; Panel 5: Anika sends the order to the coffee shop through the app and the coffee starts brewing; Panel 6: Anika and the team enjoying their coffee in the office.

Notice that the six panels of the template are populated with visuals that demonstrate the user’s experience with the Coffeehouse app. The designer used each visual to highlight a key moment in the user’s journey, including their context and motivations—why they want to use the app—and the high-level experience of successfully using the service. 

_**Pro tip:**_ _Captions are useful for interactions that may be difficult to sketch out._

The storyboard clearly identifies the character, scene, plot, and narrative of your user’s big-picture experience. Together, the six panels tell the story of how the user has used the CoffeeHouse app design to fulfill their goal!

## **Close-up storyboard**

While big-picture storyboards focus on the how and the why, close-up storyboards focus on the what. They seek to answer questions like:

- What actions or decisions need to be made on each screen of the product?
    
- What buttons are displayed on each screen of the product?
    
- What does the user do to transition from one screen to another?
    
- What are some assumptions designers are making about this experience?
    
- What are some potentially complicated interactions or pain points that will need to be addressed?
    

The close-up storyboard is less about the user experiencing your product and more focused on the details of the product itself. The close-up storyboard focuses on the practical aspects of the design, including: 

- The product’s user experience
    
- The key interactions, such as onboarding (the first impression a user has of the app)
    
- The actions, such as placing an order and checking out 
    
- Transitions between screens that will provide users with clear actions to perform to complete their goals successfully
    

Now, let’s review how the CoffeeHouse app designer approached close-up storyboarding. As you know, the **problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement** are the same for both the big-picture and close-up storyboards. But, when it comes to the sketches, the two storyboards differ. The close-up storyboard shows sketches of the actions and how the user interacts with the app.

Based on these elements and the purpose of a close-up storyboard, the designer created the following example:

![Close-up Opens in a new tab storyboard showing six panels.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/md1_WFIpSGa9lPERNTE3TA_a51957d7dd04433ea7b8a0221bd2f4f1_Mm_-kI4alTsmzaKP1W-m0NRoBz7OuIJt-PV4nG8HFYDKRH97VnONQ9mXnDywcBeuKzMUUcM9p-74XGbCF_qmYHFkVm4UcpwoL3utLvAOAR4B8_V3sP6TFXnChgXRtiUnbsV2EPO6f32w4mbMFzTBns5S6yWd9l56aoLh0I8of7RdPeslIbL8y1jQhSM7FwWEYz63EP0cPPn-XaKJrQ4aP4tOQ9g2o_cm5zMYJQ?expiry=1744416000000&hmac=mCxVArhapvGqc3aO1vEMLzkJpoN-oIwF_uNq5kwm0HU)

Panel 1: A hand clicking an icon on the phone home screen. Anika opens up the app; Panel 2: A phone screen; on the screen, it reads "Coffee" at the top, and beneath it is a map with various pins appearing. Anika selects the nearest location; Panel 3: A phone screen; on the screen, it reads "Coffee" at the top, and beneath shows options for link or QR sharing. Anika sends out the menu to the team; Panel 4: A hand interacting with a phone screen, with "Coffee" at the top and a stopwatch beneath it. Anika starts a countdown for the order; Panel 5: Three phones within the frame, all reading "5 mins." The app notifies the team that time is almost up; Panel 6: The phone screen; at the top, it reads "Coffee" and beneath, it reads "Your order" and has a send button at the bottom. Anika sends the order to be made.

Notice that the close-up storyboard sketches are focused on how the user interacts with the app. This is an effective and successful close-up storyboard, as it contains: 

- Sketches of what the CoffeeHouse app should accomplish on each panel
    
- Transitions of how the user moves from panel to panel
    
- Instructions on how the CoffeeHouse app should work
    

## **Key takeaways**

Both big-picture and close-up storyboards were used by the designer when drafting their idea for the CoffeeHouse app. These storyboards focused on the same problem statement, goal statement, and scenario statement. The designer used the big-picture storyboard to visually show important moments in the user’s journey and why the user will want to use the CoffeeHouse app. The designer created a close-up storyboard to focus more on how the user will interact with the CoffeeHouse app and the details of the app itself.
