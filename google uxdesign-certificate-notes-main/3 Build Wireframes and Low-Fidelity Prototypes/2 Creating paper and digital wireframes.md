## Information architecture (IA)

Organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product, and where the information they want is... AKA users can find what they want, quickly and intuitively.

Why is it important?

- Organizes & defines overall structure
- Provides high level view of product
- Helps stakeholders review designs
- Helps engineers understand how to architect

## 8 principles of IA

Verbatim:

1. Object principle: You should view your content as “living” and as something that changes and grows over time.
2. Choice principle: People think they want to have many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized.
3. Disclosure principle: Information should not be unexpected or unnecessary.
4. Exemplar principle: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.
5. Front door principle: The home web page doesn't need to do everything. Users often get to your site through a side entrance.
6. Multiple classification principle: People have different ways of searching for information.
7. Focused navigation principle: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.
8. Growth principle: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.

Gestalt principles

- Similarity: Elements that look similar have perceived similar functionality.
- Common region: Elements in the same areas are perceived to be grouped...
- Proximity: Things that are close together are perceived to be related.
