You’ve already learned about empathy maps and personas and how they can help you empathize with the users you’re designing for. Another helpful way to understand your users is to build a user story around their experiences with your product. As a reminder, a **user story** is a fictional one-sentence story told from the persona’s point of view to inspire and inform design decisions. This is a great opportunity to use your imagination as you create the stories that capture the needs of your users.

User stories should be written in the following format:

![A template of a statement framing the WHO, WHAT, and WHY: As a __, I want to __, so that __.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/sqKop3TqSCqiqKd06igqaA_cf3724fe91f345a2b996dd56e893b486_Screen-Shot-2020-12-11-at-5.56.02-AM.png?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=MNf5rmQsslTMDGLPlAHfG4c3tQ5auUOlDojMbmcbZGo)

A template of a statement framing the WHO, WHAT, and WHY: As a type of user (WHO), I want to action (WHAT), so that benefit (WHY).

As a **type of user** (who), I want to **action** (what) so that **benefit** (why).

Using this format is a clear way to ensure your user story is communicating everything you need to know about the persona. The user stories you create will be very valuable as you start designing your product. User stories can also serve as a “checklist” to make sure you’re addressing and solving the key problems your users might face when engaging with your product. 

The best practice for user stories is to keep them short, impactful, and to the point, with a clear action and benefit.

Practice using this format to create user stories related to the dog walker app you've been learning about.

Keeping these user stories in mind can inform the designs you’ll create. For example, in the dog walker app, users should have the ability to request a date and time for a dog walker, select a specific dog walker, and maybe even read the background checks of dog walkers, since those were all mentioned in our user stories.

Different users have different needs, so be sure to practice empathy and keep their unique needs in mind when writing user stories. To help you write the most effective user stories, check out this article from Interaction Design Foundation about [how to write user stories](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/user-stories-as-a-ux-designer-i-want-to-embrace-agile-so-that-i-can-make-my-projects-user-centered).

## Representing your users

Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. Take your time when creating user stories. Remember, as a UX designer, the user always comes first in all of your work, so it's important to understand their points of view.

# Review: Craft user stories

You’ve learned that a **user story** is a fictional, one-sentence narrative used to inspire and inform design decisions. Told from a persona’s point of view, it introduces the user, lays out an obstacle, and states the user’s ultimate goal and reasons for that goal.

Like the user personas they’re based on, user stories help teams:

- Distill key user characteristics and needs into single characters and succinct stories
    
- Prioritize and unite around clear design goals based on user needs
    
- Take a user-centered approach and make empathetic design decisions
    
- Convince stakeholders by showing how design decisions will help specific types of people
    

In this review, you will discover user stories based on the business scenario of a hypothetical company, called CoffeeHouse. You will see the CoffeeHouse scenario throughout the course as an opportunity to practice different parts of the UX design process.

**You can find the CoffeeHouse scenario below:**

# Example user stories

Here are two CoffeeHouse user personas, Anika and Ali, and their user stories:

## **Anika**

**User persona**

Anika is a marketing intern at a midsized advertising firm. Twice a week, they collect 6–12 coffees from a nearby coffee shop for their team before their morning meeting. But sometimes they find that their order is incomplete or has gotten cold from waiting too long for them to pick it up. They need a way to place an order in advance, track order status, and better plan their arrival for pickup.

**User story**

As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for the team, I want to submit and monitor group orders in advance so that I can better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time.

## **Ali**

**User persona**

Ali is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the evenings. During the daytime, Ali does an online coding boot camp for 3–4 hours to learn a new employable skill. They usually do the boot camp from local coffee shops, but sometimes they get frustrated at the limited seating. They also worry about losing their table if they get up to place a new coffee or food order. Ali could use the CoffeeHouse app to reserve an in-shop workspace and place their CoffeeHouse order through the app once they’ve arrived. 

**User story**

As a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products, I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table so that I can enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.

These examples meet all the key criteria for effective user stories. Let’s explore those criteria now.

# **User story template**

Each user story follows this classic template:

![Diagram of the template for user stories. Who: As a type of user. What: I want to action. Why: so that benefit.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/LU8208doS3ufRXnsH-e-0Q_cc0f9fd924e94512b3f4913de19c6ff1_AmxWf_vGS1f8VL6ytQjKFfvifRcaQbpxRf4LDHAsx00BwCfntOTtX3xjZFT6T05W8Qvaw0F10wiF42pTs5DzrSJYjPZKfvmY940chFi3DTPxqy99tawHX0P8EkwHMj4FcMxDS25KKedY0zvfKxZKDBw1BdGyq7zX0eQXPZQthWsgzXo1k8DBTZ7S-uZIRyI?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=iuQonN5RxWMaCCoaDsjH48SHIX70Pmww5F0tsSykbv0)

This who-what-why template helps designers craft compelling user stories that concisely express who users are, what they need, and why: 

- **Who** is the “type of user” the product is for.  
    
- **What** is the “action” the user hopes will happen.
    
- **Why** is the “benefit” the user wants to achieve from that action.
    

Notice how each example story neatly fits this template:

## **Anika**

## **Ali**

![User story template with the type of user, action, and benefit spaces filled in for Ali.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/SS1x6ddjT8WwPpwuaeaYFw_5dfab41bf8b4405d856d4c84fa6d19f1_AYr9uVHlMG4HMXL2Hi5cIjcTs2W68CreIiDVAGYQuPnEITP6CDU3hyqpwzl0lhYL4xPWhre44PUzFeRarzhm4ZL1UfDXvslM1KQ5aMTE3CqL9ktwQsE_85X76WBVNLcYgnS7-7U6YPAixRQzPuZTS1lYmaW1yOuTKBZq5hBBL-DMMCmJVvJKBUNyevlYo-Y?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=JUORBsV_4t-9eHxIpJgTm3t2xYh8GBSeJnu5EwsZF4E)

- **What:** I want to be able to order without getting up and potentially losing my table

With these features of a user in view (who, what, and why), designers are better able to make empathetic design decisions that address users’ pain points, appeal to their goals, and meet their needs.

## **Diverse types of users (Who)**

These user stories are also effective because they define users clearly and concisely, including their situations and key characteristics:

- Anika is a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for their work team.
    
- Ali is a remote student who spends 3–4 hours a day studying and purchasing products.
    

Notice also how the stories focus on diverse types of users. 

Here's a refresher on the personas’ information if you need it:

### **Anika**

- A junior employee in a busy professional firm who is typically under 23 years of age. 
    
- Several times a week, this customer goes to the CoffeeHouse to pick up an order for themselves and up to twelve coworkers. 
    
- This customer is on a tight schedule and needs to order high-quality CoffeeHouse items in advance and pick them up quickly and efficiently. 
    
- The most common frustration for this type of customer involves the coordination of their pickup. Sometimes a large order is incomplete or incorrect. Other times, the order sits too long and their coffee or hot food items get cold.
    

### **Ali**

- Someone who enjoys hanging out at CoffeeHouse and wants a place outside of their home and workplace where they can be connected and productive. This type of customer varies in age and occupation.
    
- The most common frustrations for this customer involve poor organization at the checkout counter and their inability to find adequate workspace. Waiting in line to place orders and pick up items interrupts their productivity and discourages them from placing an order. It's also important to this customer that they have access to desirable working conditions like a strong Wi-Fi connection and comfortable seating.
    

Diverse user personas and stories help designers ensure they’re designing accessible products that meet the widest possible range of user needs. They also help designers identify key commonalities between user needs so they can prioritize and unite around the most important ones.

## **User actions (What)**

Next, notice how each example story clearly identifies what the persona hopes will happen, including the pain points they want to avoid. In each story, the **what** component is an action that will help the persona avoid these pain points and have a better experience: 

- Anika’s pain point is having to submit and wait for orders at the coffee shop. The action they want to achieve is the reverse: being able to submit and monitor orders in advance. 
    
- Ali’s pain point is having to get up and potentially lose their table. The action they want to achieve is being able to place an order from their seat.
    

By defining these actions and their corresponding pain points, the CoffeeHouse designer can better address users’ needs and create a product that avoids frustrating them.

## **User benefits (Why)**

Finally, consider how each story establishes why the user wants the action to happen. For each user, the **why** goes beyond the desire to avoid pain points: 

- Anika wants to better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time when ordering for their team. 
    
- Ali wants to enjoy CoffeeHouse products and continue to work.
    

Effective UX design addresses users’ pain points while also helping them achieve goals that are meaningful to them. That’s where the **why** components of user stories come in: By defining the overarching benefits for users, designers can create more meaningful products that are not only convenient and enjoyable but also impactful on a personal level. These benefits also help designers convince stakeholders how specific design decisions will positively impact users.

## **Review your user stories**

We encourage you to create user stories for the user personas in your project portfolio. When you do, consider comparing them to the examples above, and ask yourself these questions. Do they:

- Showcase a diverse and representative set of user personas
    
- Define the types of users clearly and concisely, including key situations and characteristics (who)
    
- Establish the action each user hopes will happen, including any relevant pain points they want to avoid (what)
    
- Show the benefit the user will get from the completed action (why)
    

## **Key takeaways**

In this course and on the job, designing user stories will help you and your teams set goals and understand the problems you’re solving from your user’s perspective. Consider comparing your user stories with the ones in the example.
