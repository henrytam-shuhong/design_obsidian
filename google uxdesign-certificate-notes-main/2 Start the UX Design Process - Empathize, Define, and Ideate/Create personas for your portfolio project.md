## Persona examples

Below are three completed exemplar personas that were created based on the example prompts you’ve been following throughout this course.

- The first is a 38-year-old music teacher who could use an app or a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner for his ear pain. 
    
- The second is a college student looking to rent out pavilion space for his book club events who would like to use an app or a website that allows him to view event spaces in parks throughout the city, reserve an available space, and pay the rental fees. 
    
- The third is a passionate and driven businesswoman who owns and operates her own small retail business. She’s looking for an app or a website that will help her monitor and track her inventory, add new inventory, and grow her business. 
    

All three personas represent specific user groups, rather than a single individual. 

## **Example 1**

![User persona for Elijah Robinson which includes a short bio, demographic details, an image, a quote, his goals, and his](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/6KVGmRgrSKOJ83qHP-0Fkg_188b1de6aa89469fb18204de11ba6ef1_Lnlc8yQzI2uyNDHDQ0WKJte1mOThdeebTMpXpnpZjiTc-Eg3yjGFsQzXBkkhc58732lKgIE--maw8Bo-MMEXul1oDZ4a6HSmDys3myPRzyNwYjdiVvsQKAkROJS38_k0KUHO289Ll0fxhyiBZNU5n7WmDtcYYB-AAhqqbO7ebpS4dDaAZhMGF5r6vrlhlbE?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=4o_1O5Px1A0oVN7d42KQzFAsyz1cfKVGlGTVdEd6byA)

frustrations. Elijah has played music his entire life. He works as a music teacher for a local middle school and in his free time, he plays in a local band with his partner. His greatest joy in life is working with kids and helping them discover a love of music. Recently, he’s been having some ear pain, but doesn’t have a primary care physician. Elijah needs to find an available healthcare practitioner near him to get his ear checked out. Elijah is 38 years old; he has a Master of Arts in Music Education; he lives in Saugatuck, Michigan; he’s married with no children; and he’s a middle school music teacher. Goals: To continue to perform with his band and teach kids music; to create a space with his partner where kids in the community who don’t have access to instruments can learn music and play instruments for free; to share his love of music with his community. Frustrations: He is starting to have ear pain and is beginning to lose his hearing in his left ear; he is worried that hearing issues will prevent him from playing with his band and teaching kids music; he doesn’t have a primary care provider and is worried about finding someone who can help him; he doesn’t want to give up on his dream of bringing music to kids who don’t have access at home.

Notice how the designer included a short, introductory bio that speaks to Elijah’s character and the type of person he is at the top. Above his demographic information, the designer has included a short quote that hints at Elijah’s passion for music, and they’ve also included a photo that is representative of this sample group. Elijah’s demographic details are called out below his photograph in a different color from the rest of the template, and to the left are his goals and a list of frustrations. Within the short introduction, the designer has also described Elijah’s need to find time in between his busy work schedule to see a medical professional about his ear pain. In the same space, they included Elijah’s dilemma: that he hasn’t had the time or the resources to see that medical professional until now. 

## **Example 2**

![User persona for Isaiah Uduike which includes a short bio, demographic details, an image, a quote, his goals, and his](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/38vWtKo2R0q_7EMEtsdqcg_8724516b77254a089cd401e0a0cfabf1_TqdnA10ZRvRGS-aBB1U3RGqjlvsI5intphg1_8iuPjUwMwfjmzrR8pRmNJjLdwYDF8m4X-3OL27JfDIJwh9U92Q_w_opunE159XSb5AK0tfz_ZCQI1PkLPtxUZfRpPvyC1oQ-FaFf20yZrJG42vmSq_r-N-odoqeyT0gkwe7_WG8KD_bICe9L1yTEkDXZ4Q?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=SCgCJXmDBik9Xl5Q8hOczgA_U7Ln_9Nh9pubI6X7zLk)

frustrations. Isaiah is a fourth-year university student who loves to read books and write. They are the founder of an off-campus book club which meets bi-weekly near their University. This book club is their way to meet and socialize with like-minded people who share the same interests. They need to find inexpensive—preferably free!—dog-friendly places to meet with their book club for their end-of-semester event. Isaiah is 22 years old and is in a writing program at the University of Göttingen, Germany. They’re single, have one dog, and work part-time as a server in a restaurant. Goals: To find an inexpensive place where their book club can meet for their end-of-semester event; to find a location that will allow them to bring their dog—likely an outdoor space; to organize an open-mic night that coincides with their book club in the hopes that more people will come to their event; to meet more people that share their passion for books and writing.  Frustrations: Their income is limited because they’re a university student who works part-time; not many well-known event spaces allow dogs; they are a shy, introverted person and it’s difficult for them to meet new people.

Elena is a passionate and hardworking business woman who manages and operates her own retail store. She is looking for ways to save money, generate revenue, and automate her inventory processes.

She is 58 years old; she has an Associate of Science in Business Administration and lives in Brooklyn, New York; she’s married and has three children and five grandchildren, and is a retail store owner. Her quote is, “My journey of becoming a business owner wasn’t easy—it took a lot of hard work and determination—but I never lost my passion for my work and I’m looking forward to what I can do for myself in the future.” Goals: To be financially secure enough for retirement; to expand her business and establish more store locations throughout the local area; to employ technology to help her improve her management processes; to reduce (or optimize) the amount of time it takes to conduct inventory; to implement a simpler inventory process that her staff can handle even when she’s not around. Frustrations: She feels she doesn’t have the right tools to manage her business well, her business has recently experienced some financial losses, she’s worked hard to establish her store within her community, and she’s frustrated with how long her inventory processes are taking and it’s starting to impact the time she could be spending with family.
