You’ve spent a lot of time learning about the users you're designing for, and how empathy and user research can improve your understanding of users' needs. As a reminder, here's where you're at in the design process:

- **Empathizing** with users allows you to consider the product experience from the users’ perspective. By connecting with people directly, like through interviews, you can discover and understand users' likes, dislikes, and pain points. 
    
- Then, sort through research you collected about users to **define** the problem they're facing. Creating a problem statement helps you clearly define the user pain points that your future designs can address.
    

Now, you can begin coming up with solutions that address those problems! You’re ready to create hypothesis statements. A **hypothesis statement** is an educated guess about what you think the solution to a design problem might be. You know the challenges users are facing, so it’s time to consider how your designs can alleviate their pain points.

Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write one.

First, you can use the **if / then format** to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of if/then hypothesis statements applied to the users of the dog walker app:

- **If** Arnold downloads the dog walker app, **then** they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions. 
    
- **If** Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, **then** they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.
    

Second, you can use the **we believe format** to come up with a hypothesis statement. Here are examples of we believe hypothesis statements applied to the dog walker app:

- **We believe that** a simplified mode of the dog walker app **for** Arnold **will** allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.
    
- **We believe that** easy access to available dog walkers **for** Tobias **will** increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets.
    

If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users. On the other hand, we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.

You might encounter situations where you have multiple hypothesis statements for one problem statement. That’s okay! There will always be multiple solutions for the problems that users are facing. Your job as a UX designer is to use your creativity and problem-solving skills to decide which solutions work best for the unique users you’re designing for.

Hypothesis statements help you narrow down your research insights into goals for your product, so you can stay focused on the wants and needs of your users.

# Review: Build problem statements and hypothesis statements

You’ve learned that problem statements and hypothesis statements help UX designers establish design goals and define deliverables. A problem statement describes a user need that the product must address. A hypothesis statement communicates the designer’s best educated guess about how to address that need. 

A strong **problem statement** meets these criteria:

- Human-centered
    
- Broad enough for creative freedom
    
- Narrow enough to be solved by a practical design solution
    

A strong **hypothesis statement** communicates a practical design solution to the need in the problem statement.

Now, you’ll review the templates for problem and hypothesis statements and then explore examples from the CoffeeHouse app scenario you’ve considered in previous course items. 

## **Problem statement template**

A problem statement can be written with this process: 

1. Start with the name of a user persona
    
2. Add a short description of the user’s characteristics 
    
3. Clearly describe the user’s need
    
4. Explain why the user has that need
    

The reason for the need (the “why”) should be an **actionable insight** that the designer can address in their design. 

This process should yield a problem statement that more or less fits this template:

**[User name]** is a/an **[user characteristics]** who needs **[user need]** because **[insight].**

## CoffeeHouse problem statement

Here is an example of a problem statement for Anika, one of the CoffeeHouse user personas you’ve met before:

Anika’s problem statement:

- **Anika** is a/an **busy marketing intern** who needs **a faster, more collaborative way to take many coffee orders from co-workers at one time** because **taking individual orders takes too much time and isn't a good use of Anika's time.**
    

![Problem statement template completed with information about user Anika.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NDX1bAvASLyqC157zmFqqQ_a61e13d94f94432f99f62f73028910f1_G4oV19Za6Ucmr_HQv1ngSZMq1GvwlJO8hBfFSxWNQvENk0G4F9ytCYPEf4FbMAoAwhDY1AhlzhLGrT_EtknsuO-BlSGu6X7VKWvlnFpwaeqi6i7FYrkig8FptsUaQ51OBslyKPYoidooUS--ordFV5HmtlNUvpAW3DzFizWehK3DZ-sgq_vuvx5T2xV9OTc?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=kJ-d1CbnVkebcaeSizdeimFcrh7iy6DK_eLSwfOkGFM)

This is a well-written problem statement. It will help the design team establish their design goals, understand constraints, define key deliverables, and create benchmarks for success. Consider how the statement supports these outcomes. Working off the statement, designers can clearly articulate:

- The **goal** of developing an app that enables groups to place orders collaboratively and efficiently. 
    
- The short time **constraints** in which users like Anika need to place collaborative group orders.
    
- The design **deliverables** they need to achieve that goal, such as a prototype for a collaborative ordering system.
    
- The **benchmarks** for their design’s success, such as faster ordering and time on task for placing collaborative group orders.
    

Notice also how this problem statement fits these key criteria. It is:

- **Human-centered** and focused on the needs of a specific type of user.
    
- **Broad** enough to allow designers creative freedom in envisioning and designing a solution.
    
- **Narrow** enough to be solved by a practical design solution.
    

## **Hypothesis statement template**

Based on an effective problem statement, a hypothesis statement can be written with this process: 

1. Determine an action that could solve your user’s need.
    
2. Specify the outcome that you expect from the action.
    

This process often yields hypothesis statements that more or less fit this if/then template:

If **[action]**, then **[outcome]**.

This template often works, but hypothesis statements don’t need to have a standard form. Sometimes an if/then statement may sound unnatural, so designers may reword their if/then statements to create statements that are more flexible.

Regardless of the form they take, effective hypothesis statements give designers an easy way to communicate their best educated guesses about which actions will best address users’ needs and achieve the outcomes users desire.

## CoffeeHouse hypothesis statement

![If/then statement template completed with information about Anika.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/HxnPQA-qTAmSa8zX68pEFw_002ae9bcda644d95a48d920d382e92f1_fb2O99VZ8up_iNPCB_tsyn18XgkmosYrUb0v5XPkHw1-lPBl39blRMr7dvj5UJ2uO3ICo36P7q9pHi2p5sb7g1kb_xLD3tUKCny1ZnMGxsFRcsif5NH-bFOMizkEolWkf7f1-6RIxs0qy7Qs4-O2nJn1EdjfaMiua5PqV1DH2Sg6FuOPK-AhiB1yUp6mDiI?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=Hx0vc-4YoZSQzxWdKr6CjHoe2tdmYZEndpBj-hWU8Ds)

Here’s the hypothesis statement that the CoffeeHouse designers created for Anika’s problem statement:

- **Anika's hypothesis statement:** If Anika uses the CoffeeHouse app to collect orders and submit them, then they can get coffee for everyone in the office quickly and easily.
    

By building on Anika’s problem statement, this hypothesis statement expresses a clear design goal and criteria for success:

- **Goal:** Anika’s goal is to collect and submit group orders. This is the solution the app should enable the user to achieve.
    
- **Criteria:** Anika wants to get coffee for all their colleagues quickly and efficiently, so their criteria for success are the speed, efficiency, and completeness of their orders. These criteria will help designers determine whether their solution is successful.
    

## **A problem and hypothesis pair**

You’ve explored a problem statement and hypothesis statement on their own, but the power of these statements lies in how they build on one another. Here’s another CoffeeHouse example with the problem statement and hypothesis statement paired closely together. As you explore them, consider how the hypothesis builds on the problem statement:

**Ali problem statement:** Ali is a remote student who needs to place and receive orders without leaving their table because if they get up to order, someone else might sit at the table and they will lose their spot.

![Problem statement template completed with information about Ali.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/rQyPE2ODSeeeAx2Rc2upGA_a5ebb905d1b943309f8befde3b83e5f1_xs56hX2ADKGLO5f7RIPap5oz1FqmtFgD3PXJwQDyitjrv82WH-jTw86XzNihpev4COL3tySzX-6rpmCfb4I6emtpakqBEyrqcFB1KASZSUfUvp3FcyFpIaXRbfEcodwHf2ZkWLDgMp2r_Ar_UWwVRO0tPP0ZjWxlI-fOCJ1cNK3dggKmz6QRV277AxbsbSc?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=T9oLsJ98AKqG48gdF8U7EuDFC_H1kZOyJVIdUCg2a1g)

**Ali hypothesis statement:** If Ali uses the CoffeeHouse app to place an in-store order from their table, then an employee can deliver their order so Ali won't lose the table.

![If/then statement template completed with information about Ali.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/RL2x8sQDS5eJO5FxsewmwQ_90cd7bfd5bd74053a94d70b9a3485cf1_TGFv4EC_kAKV-0Ln0QBoOW31-0F9_XtKgg8oX_znPJzU4uDcibi4EaQg5RvE0PmfTjzNzJIPv5X8vLmYsgd9HMfIIActCnnqDZ_BMpW91xN4tN8FTZFoQOm9pFTNgvlKizQzsQlWFhc2bDx1HeQXqpf4NpafBRVEBsG3TRGdOQefTCXZ7695BO2c6nyNHt8?expiry=1744329600000&hmac=azbFuD6XF8VMGdfttfV-Tn6lH-TkN6eLPM-Aw3mXrdA)

Notice how the problem and hypothesis statements perfectly mirror each other. Ali’s situation, problem, and pain points all focus on Ali wanting to place orders while also keeping their spot in the coffee shop. And the designer’s hypothesis succinctly predicts how the app will address that problem and those pain points in the context of Ali’s situation.

## **Review your problem and hypothesis statements**

When you create problem and hypothesis statements for your portfolio projects, use the examples and criteria above to guide and assess your work. As you review your work and iterate, ask yourself these questions:

Have you constructed a problem statement that is:

- Human-centered and focused on the needs of a specific persona?
    
- Broad enough for creative freedom?
    
- Narrow enough to be solved by a practical design solution?
    

Based on your problem statement, does your hypothesis statement establish:

- The specific action that your solution should enable the user to do or achieve?
    
- The desired outcome that determines whether your solution was successful in meeting the user’s need?
    

## **Key takeaways**

Problem statements are an essential first step in the define phase of the design process. Strong problem and hypothesis statements help a design team align on which user problem to focus on, and they give everyone a clear goal. To be competitive for UX design positions, designers must be able to show that they can distill user information into succinct and compelling problems and hypotheses that drive narrowly focused and practical design work.
