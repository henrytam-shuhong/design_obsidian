## **User journey map examples**

In this reading, you will review three completed exemplar user journey maps that were created based on the example prompts you’ve been following throughout this certificate. To access these prompts, refer to [_Choose your portfolio prompt_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/start-ux-design-process/item/EuPzq). 

- The first prompt is for a busy 38-year-old music teacher without immediate access to a primary care physician. He could use an app or a responsive website to find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner for his ear pain. 
    
- The second is for a university student looking to rent out pavilion space for their book club events and open mic nights that allow dogs. They would like to use an app or a website that allows them to view event spaces in parks throughout the city, reserve an available space, and pay the rental fees. 
    
- The third is for a passionate, hard-working business woman who owns and operates her own small retail business. She’s looking for an app or a website that will help her monitor and track her inventory, add new inventory, and grow her business. 
    

You can compare your own work with these examples, which meet all the criteria required for a user journey map. Use them as references to help you develop your own user journey maps for your portfolio project. 

## **Example #1**

This first example is a user journey map for Elijah Robinson, a 38-year-old music teacher and musician. Over the years, he’s developed ear pain as a result of being regularly exposed to loud noise. He doesn’t have access to a primary care provider. He could use an app or a responsive website to help him find, compare, select, and contact a healthcare practitioner for his ear pain.

## **Example #2**

This second example is a user journey map for Isaiah Uduike, a 22-year-old student studying at a university in Seattle, Washington. They’re the founder of an off-campus book club which meets bi-weekly and allows them to socialize and meet new people. They’re looking for inexpensive places to host their end-of-semester book club event, but they have no idea where to start. They could use an app or responsive website that allows them to search for and reserve available outdoor event spaces—like pavilions—in the city park system.

I’m a bit unsure…I chose three options and discussed it with club members since we all contribute to rental fees; I chose one that’s nearby and allows dogs, and reserved it. I’m apprehensive, but excited! I made flyers, sent emails and posted the book club event, date, and location on social media. I’m frustrated—the pavilion administrator couldn’t find my reservation. It was resolved, but I almost had to cancel.

## **Example #3**

In this third example, a 58-year old businesswoman named Elena Smith is looking to automate her inventory processes. She’s a passionate, hard-working, small business owner who spends too much time at the end of every day taking inventory and creating new orders, and she would love an app or responsive website that allows her to view her inventory, add new inventory, track her sales, and view other inventory information in one place. It would be helpful if her staff were able to take on some of these tasks as well. Elena is tired of working long hours to manually do these tasks, and she wants to have more time at the end of each day for herself and to focus on her dream of growing her business.

Each of the three exemplars include the persona and the business goal above the journey map table. In the first row, each exemplar lists the different actions the user will take to fulfill their need. In the second row, each exemplar lists the different tasks the users will need to complete before moving onto the next action (the next column). In the third row, each exemplar lists and describes the feelings and emotions of the user at each stage of their user journey. Finally, the fourth row of each exemplar lists any opportunities for improvement throughout the user journey that would improve the functionality or features of the app or responsive website. 

## **Key takeaways**

Compare the exemplars above to your completed self review. Review the following criteria used to evaluate the exemplars to assess your work. As you compare, ask yourself, “Have I…”: 

- Defined relevant actions along the user’s journey?
    
- Captured two to three tasks for each action?
    
- Identified at least one feeling for each action?
    
- Identified opportunities for improvement for at least three steps of the user journey?
    
- Considered accessibility throughout the user journey?
    
- Identified ways to reduce designer bias and its impact on the user journey?
