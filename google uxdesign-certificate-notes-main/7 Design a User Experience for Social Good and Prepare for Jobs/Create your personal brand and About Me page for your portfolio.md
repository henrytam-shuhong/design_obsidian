Your personal brand is an essential way to demonstrate your unique value as a designer. When working as a UX designer, your personal brand gives others a sense of the designer behind your final products. You want to build a personal brand that showcases the type of work you want to do and your unique abilities for doing that work.

Your personal brand reflects your career identity, which is the unique value you bring to the workforce. If you'd like to learn some foundational knowledge about developing your career identity, feel free to [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_xbT4qMrot4)

. Discovering and defining your own career identity makes you better equipped to develop your personal brand.

Don’t worry, you don’t need to have your personal brand and career identity all figured out just yet! For now, we just want to get you started by reviewing how a UX designer started developing their own personal brand. You can use it as a guide when you’re ready to work on your own.

## **Access the template**

When you’re ready to start the process, open the personal branding template and select **USE TEMPLATE.**

## **Part 1: How do I see myself?**

First, review and reflect on the questions from the template about all the ways your personality, unique skills, and values as a designer intersect with your public persona. Ask yourself:

1. What is an activity or idea I am passionate about? How does this passion motivate me as a designer?
    
2. List two or three things I value. How do I express these values in my everyday life?
    
3. What are my biggest strengths? What are the things I am naturally good at or have learned to do well?
    
4. What do I want people to recognize me for?
    

## **Part 2: How do others see me?**

Then ask three or more people (e.g., friend, co-worker, manager, family member) to answer the following questions about you:

1. What is an activity or idea you think I am passionate about?
    
2. What are some things you think I value?
    
3. What strengths do you think I have?
    
4. What makes me stand out from other people you know or work with?
    

## **Part 3: Begin crafting a personal brand**

When you’re crafting your brand, think about how to bring your self-perception and public perception closer together. Ideally, how you see yourself will be similar to how others describe you. A well-crafted personal statement gives you a consistent and efficient way to present your brand.

Follow these steps from the template to begin crafting your personal brand:

1. Compare your answers from part 1 (how you see yourself) and part 2 (how others see you). What were the similarities? If there were surprising differences, what were they?
    
2. From this comparison between the answers in parts 1 and 2, compile a list of words or phrases that best capture an authentic view of your brand. Add new words or phrases that help bridge the gap in those areas in which there is a difference between how you see yourself and how others see you.
    
3. Finally, arrange the words and phrases from question 2 into statements that describe you in a way that expresses your brand, starting with something like “[Your name] is known for...”
    

## **Draft your personal brand statement**

After you complete the worksheet, take time to reflect on what you learned about yourself and how you might incorporate some of these insights into your personal statement. 

Then, write a one or two-sentence phrase that describes what you do and what you stand for. The personal statement can be thought of as a tagline or slogan that communicates a designer’s brand and can be an important element in a portfolio.

## **Example personal brand statement:**

Here’s an example of a personal brand statement:

- “Dhani is known for their belief in the power of technology to create more inclusive communities.”
    

Notice how this statement begins to tell a story about the person behind the designs!

Your brand should be consistent everywhere you have a professional presence. For example, on social media accounts, profiles on professional networking communities like LinkedIn and Behance, a resume, and business cards. In fact, one advantage of a good personal statement is that it usually can fit on your business card! You can start by adding your brand statement to your portfolio website. 

## **Tell your "About Me" story**

Your personal statement often captures only a part of the story behind your brand, which is why another important element of a portfolio website is the About Me page. 

The Personal Brand Template should provide you with some good material for drafting an About Me page for your portfolio. You should already have several statements collected that describe you in a way that expresses your brand. Use the template answers to create a more complete description of your brand to include in your About Me page. A personal statement is a great way to begin your About Me story! 

Follow these steps to begin crafting your About Me story:

1. Draft the About Me page on a new blank document.
    
2. Consider these questions about the audience: 
    
    1. What do potential employers and recruiters want to know about me?
        
    2. What am I hoping for them to learn about me?
        
3. Consider other information to include:
    
    1. What kind of work do I do?
        
    2. What am I passionate about, or what things do I value?
        
    3. What kind of work culture am I seeking?
        
    4. Where do I work currently, and is my job in a related field?
        
    5. What types of teams have I worked on in the past? (remote, in-person, freelance)
        
    6. What are my credentials, like this certificate and any additional education?
        
    7. Have I completed notable projects, worked with notable clients, or received notable awards?
        
    8. What is my contact information, including email address and links to profiles on professional networking sites?
        
    9. What is a picture (or two) that captures and communicates my personal brand?
        

## Choose fonts and a color scheme

For those creatives out there, choosing what fonts to use and determining a color scheme can be an especially fun part of the portfolio design process! Fonts and colors affect the look and feel of a portfolio website and have a strong influence on a user’s experience.

When you’re ready, follow these guidelines:

- Choose fonts and colors that align with your personal brand. 
    
- Use no more than two fonts.
    
- Select a small set of colors. To start, choose one or two primary colors and a couple of accent colors. 
    

Make sure you apply the same color scheme and fonts to all of your online profiles and to your resume, in addition to your portfolio. This helps maintain consistency in a personal brand. 

## Key takeaways

A personal statement is a great way to introduce yourself as a designer and can help you stand out from others. You can use this reading as a guide when you’re ready to work on your own personal brand statement. You can also access the personal brand statement template to answer the questions, reflect, and craft your personal brand statement.

Make sure you ask yourself these questions:

- Did I answer the questions about how I see myself?
    
- Did I ask others the questions to understand how others see me?
    
- Did I reflect on how to bring my self-perceptions and public perceptions together?
    
- Did I draft a personal statement with 1–2 sentences that reflect what I do best (my strengths and values) and how I do it uniquely (my qualities that make me stand out)?
    
- Did I draft an About Me statement that expanded upon my personal brand statement?
    
- Did I apply all the same fonts and color scheme aligned to my personal brand to all of my online profiles, my resume, and my portfolio?
