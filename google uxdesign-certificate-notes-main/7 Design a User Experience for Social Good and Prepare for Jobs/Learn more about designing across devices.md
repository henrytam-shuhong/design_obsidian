As a UX designer, it’s important to consider how the designs you create will adapt for multiple devices, including desktop computers, tablets, mobile phones, smartwatches, TVs, and smart displays. The list of devices with screens that need UX design is growing every day!

As you design across devices, you’ll need to consider the device’s screen size, the interaction between the device and the user, the way content will be organized on various screen sizes, the way users will interact with each device, and more.

To provide a great user experience across devices, keep in mind the four C’s: 

- **Consistency:** Having a uniform design, so users can expect the design to feel familiar across devices and products
    
- **Continuity:** Providing users with a smooth and uninterrupted experience as they move between devices
    
- **Context:** Designing for the needs of a specific device and the way in which the user will use that device in any given situation
    
- **Complementary:** Taking into account how the product design on each device can make the overall user experience better

Whenever you work on a new project for your portfolio, consider how your designs will adapt for multiple devices. These considerations will be part of the framework you can use beyond this course as you add to your portfolio in the future.
