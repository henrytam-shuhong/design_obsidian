In this course, you’ll be given the guidance and the option to **design for social good** by creating a dedicated mobile app and a complementary responsive website to showcase in your professional UX portfolio.

How does designing for social good differ from designing any other product? As you’ve learned, every UX design project is about resolving pain points that real users are facing. But designing for social good takes that concept a step further by creating solutions that lead to “collective social good.” In other words, designing for social good is a way for UX designers to address problems going on in their communities and drive positive change in society. 

Focusing on user pain points that lead to societal change is vital work because it prioritizes problems that might otherwise be ignored in lieu of profitable gain or convenience. Designing for social good is often tied to equitable access, like increasing access to quality education or health care, decreasing poverty, tackling environmental concerns, and more.

For example, electric power vehicles started to grow in popularity in the mid-2000s. Before this time, the automobile industry sold millions of vehicles that operated on petroleum-based fuel. There was extensive evidence suggesting that this practice contributed to the harming of the environment, so engineers and designers turned their focus to creating alternative transportation that was sustainable and environmentally friendly. Now, energy efficient vehicles are accessible to many car buyers and governments around the world. That's designing for social good in action!

As you continue your journey as a UX designer, your projects can impact the lives of users everywhere. Designing products that specifically aim to drive social good means your work can help fix monumental issues and improve the lives of diverse communities. Check out some examples of designing for social good that can serve as inspiration as you begin this course. 

## **Community Keijiban**

Of the 15,000 residents in Wakabadai danchi—a housing complex in Yokohama, Japan—almost half are over the age of 65. Most residents live alone and, initially, were unfamiliar with digital ways to connect with others.

To make sure that elderly residents didn’t feel lonely and to give them opportunities to socialize, the Yamayuri Club was established. A few members of the club thought using Google Home devices could help residents remember activities, share community notices, and drive feelings of positivity in the community.

So, developers at the digital agency Toaster partnered with Experiments with Google to create the Community Keijiban app. This app empowers residents to connect to a voice-powered notice board on any Google smart home product, which sends community notices and reminds residents when it’s time to attend activities. This design drives social good by connecting elderly community members to each other, thereby decreasing loneliness.

## **Seeing Music**

Two computer-generated images from a tool called Seeing Music, that translates music into a visual form of shapes, colors, and patterns.

Seeing Music is a tool for visualizing sounds. Sing or play sounds into the microphone on your computer, and the tool will show the textures of sounds or the paths and shapes of melodies. 

Why is a tool like Seeing Music important? According to the [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/deafness-and-hearing-loss#:~:text=Disabling%20hearing%20loss%20refers%20to,%2D%20and%20middle%2Dincome%20countries.)

, over 5% of the world’s population has disabling hearing loss. Seeing Music helps people who have hearing disabilities experience music as an art form and explore sounds in unique ways.

Two images from the Simple mobile app. On the left, a patient screen allows users to input a patient's name or scan their blood pressure passport. On the right, a screen for entering a patient's blood pressure, including systolic and diastolic numbers.

Simple is a free and easy-to-use mobile app that aims to reduce the number of people in economically developing nations dying from heart disease and strokes.

The app supports large-scale hypertension and chronic disease management programs by enabling health care workers to record patient information in less than 20 seconds. This helps healthcare professionals research and treat patients quickly. To date, Simple has helped manage information for over 500,000 patients with hypertension.
