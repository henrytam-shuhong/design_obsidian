Effective preparation before a job interview is critical for your success. One of the ways to prepare is by thinking about how to present yourself, and your skills, in the best way to potential employers. In this review, you’ll explore an example elevator pitch: a short description of a person or product and why it’s important. 

An effective elevator pitch is a brief and detailed description of who you are. It should answer the common interview prompt of, “Tell me about yourself.” The term “elevator” is used because this pitch should be brief enough that you could deliver it during an elevator ride.

## **Explore the example**

With the template in mind, review this completed example from a designer named Carlos.

I’m Carlos, and I’m a user experience (UX) designer with experience in interaction design and research, gained through two externships with small and medium-sized organizations. 

Through my work with Company X, I’ve helped organizations to improve the user experience tied to their products through planning and conducting usability studies, creating sitemaps and wireframes, and helping to improve the information architecture of the company’s website. 

I love being able to use research and interaction design insights to improve the experiences of all types of users. 

Company Y’s mission is to create a user experience for their products that focuses on equity, diversity, and inclusion. As a junior-level designer and current user of Company Y’s products, this really appeals to me.

## **Who I am**

In the first sentence of the pitch, notice how Carlos includes details about their personal and professional background:

**Who I am:** _I’m Carlos, and I’m a user experience (UX) designer with experience in interaction design and research, gained through two externships with small and medium-sized organizations._ 

Ideally, it’s best to fit all these ideas into just one sentence. For more details about Carlos’s skills, potential employers can always check their resume or portfolio. The **Who I am** section should be very brief! 

## **What I bring**

In the next section of the pitch, notice how Carlos explains how they can make a contribution to the organization they are applying to work with:

**What I bring:** _Through my work with Company X, I’ve helped organizations to improve the user experience tied to their products through planning and conducting usability studies, creating sitemaps and wireframes, and helping to improve the information architecture of the company’s website._

Here, Carlos focuses on creating a picture of the value that their work, knowledge, and experience has brought to past employers. Details about past experiences prove Carlos’s ability to add value to a new company in the future.

## **Why I love the work**

In the next sentence, Carlos briefly explains what they love about being a UX designer and what inspires them.

**Why I love the work:** _I love being able to use research and interaction design insights to improve the experiences of all types of users._

As with the **Who I am** portion of the elevator pitch, the **Why I love the wor**k section should be brief. To understand why, remember that showing is always more convincing than telling: It’s important for Carlos to tell potential employers why they love UX design, but it’s even more important to show them by providing details in the **What I bring** and **Why I’m interested** sections. Those details show Carlos’s passion for UX design and ability to add value to a company.

## **Why I’m interested**

Finally, notice how the last section of Carlos’s pitch shows potential employers the link between their  past experience and their values and mission. 

**Why I’m interested:** _Company Y’s mission is to create a user experience for their products that focuses on equity, diversity, and inclusion. As a junior-level designer and current user of Company Y’s products, this really appeals to me._ 

In these sentences, Carlos focuses on why they want to work for the company! They build on **What I bring,** where Carlos describes how they contributed to organizations or teams in the past. For this section, it’s okay to divide key ideas into two sentences. 

## **Key takeaways**

Elevator pitches are valuable tools for summarizing and sharing your experience, passions, and talents in a way that appeals to future employers. If you haven’t developed one yet, consider taking some time to do so now!
