When interviewing with potential employers, it’s important to communicate who you are, your value as a designer, and what you’re searching for in a job. A simple way to do this is with an elevator pitch. An **elevator pitch** is a short, memorable description that explains a concept in an easy-to-understand way. In an interview, a strong elevator pitch helps you stand out to the interviewer and explains why you’re a good fit for a role — all in about 60 seconds!

One of the first things asked in an interview is often “tell me about yourself.”  This question might be vague, so it is a great place to use your elevator pitch to make a positive impression.

There are four parts to a UX designer’s elevator pitch. Let's go through each one!

![Give an intro: an icon with an id badge that says, "Hello, I am..." with a person's face.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/NxjW_DZ_ToCY1vw2f-6ATg_976ae8f2074b49c39dc73342cc9170c8_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.04-AM.png?expiry=1744588800000&hmac=RCXnAgSucfm0ba2Mp7GrI98bwMYZ8SF5_IczgKNDuyU)

**Give an intro (“Who I am”).** This is where you’ll introduce yourself and give a brief overview of your professional background. Tell the interviewer some of the job roles you’ve had, your years of work experience, and the types of industries you’ve worked in. If this is your first UX role, don’t be afraid to mention some of your past roles that are unrelated. You could say, “I’ve been working for over five years as a customer support professional and shift lead.”

![Describe your background: an icon with a magnifying a person's picture.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/nHiT0HRJToW4k9B0Sc6FAA_27bc3ca3831840f58cdfb0e84a6d314a_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.09-AM.png?expiry=1744588800000&hmac=r7zdfTLVwrOKD5pT8Wq3Gcl3AdsyLi93t4g7ZNcN_84)

**Describe your background and state your purpose (“What I bring”)**. Describe your background and state that you’re a UX designer. Even if you’re interviewing for your first internship or job in UX design, it’s important to clarify that this is your career. For example, you could say,  “I want to apply my excellent customer service skills to design and create unforgettable user experiences for every person.”

![Show your excitement to work in UX: An icon with a user that has stars for eyes and is excited.](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/x6aGDcBbQymmhg3AW2MpIw_32458051dd03452eb64b70c63680288e_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.15-AM.png?expiry=1744588800000&hmac=wMhpzkKh3NQs9movsoheFQj1SnH1WjMe56MF5joWY40)

**Show your excitement to work in UX design (“Why I love the work”)**. This is where you share your passion for the field of UX design and why you want to work in the industry. If you’re motivated to make apps more equitable, mention that. Focus on why you’re interested in UX design and how you want to use your role to make a difference in the profession. This is a good time to talk about your goals. For example, you could say, “I love design that makes technology accessible for users of all backgrounds, needs, and experiences worldwide.”

![Communicate your interest in the company](https://d3c33hcgiwev3.cloudfront.net/imageAssetProxy.v1/5aqrv-CYQg-qq7_gmFIP-w_b4f35e8535fc4159bb482ae38027637c_Screen-Shot-2021-02-22-at-9.57.20-AM.png?expiry=1744588800000&hmac=U6tZY0Q-ACVe4UucLcsc1O7Y6uWrg8lsW5x_KWnJwfU)

**Communicate your interest in the company (“Why I am here”)**. This is where you make clear that you want the job you’re interviewing for. Why is this job the right fit for you? And how will the company benefit from having you on the team? For example, if you were interviewing at YouTube you could say, “YouTube’s mission is to give everyone a voice and show them the world. I’m looking forward to the opportunity to be a part of that mission and provide outstanding design solutions for my favorite app.”

This might seem like a lot to say about yourself in 60 seconds, but if you prepare your elevator pitch before the interview, you’ll feel more confident while talking to potential employers. And confidence during an interview is a good thing! Practice it with a friend or family member, or record yourself giving your pitch to figure out what you should change or emphasize. 

## Examples of elevator pitches

To bring the structure of an elevator pitch to life, check out two examples of elevator pitches from UX designers at Google.

### Karen

Interaction designer, Material Design

I’m Karen, a UX designer with a background in design as well as business development. I’ve designed for a range of companies, including a design studio, startup, design agency, as well as a tech company. Currently, I’m a designer on the Material Design team at Google. My work on Material Design has been used by many internal teams and external clients. 

I’ve worked on a variety of topics, such as accessibility, enterprise, consumer, commerce, and more novel interaction types, like the voice assistant. I’ve been able to hone my interaction and visual design skills through working on a diverse set of projects and topics. 

I love working on experiences that address the needs of different people — it’s one of the reasons why I enjoy working on accessibility design. I thrive on working on projects that are not just about improving people’s overall experience with products, apps, and services, but also from working on complex and unfamiliar topics, which help expand my horizons.

Making information universally accessible and useful is part of Google’s mission, and those areas happen to also be a focus of my work. I’m thankful to have the opportunity to work on topics and projects that align with my personal career goals. 

### Erika

Visual designer, Google Assistive Learning

I'm Erika, a visual designer, UX designer, and systems thinker at Google, with eight years of user-centered design experience.

I like to think of myself as a design jack-of-all-trades, with an emphasis on visual design. My expertise is shown best through fine tuning visual details and identifying inconsistent patterns throughout the UX process.

I love to solve problems using human-centered approaches by always putting the user first, and that's why I love UX. I work closely with diverse users around the world to find creative ways for them to intuitively and delightfully use the products that I work on.

Working at Google allows me and my work to reach millions of people and help solve problems like the equity gap that exists in education though design. I genuinely believe in the good that Google sets out to accomplish with creative and innovative technology applications.
