In this lesson, you’ve learned what AI is and how it might help you as a UX designer. Then, you practiced prompting a generative AI (gen AI) tool to produce useful outputs. It’s helpful to use the T-C-R-E-I (task, context, references, evaluate, and iterate) framework to guide your prompts. When you Thoughtfully Create Really Excellent Inputs, you’re more likely to get results that work for you!

Keep experimenting with gen AI tools to brainstorm ideas, boost your productivity, help you avoid mistakes, and aid in your decision-making process. Practice with Gemini or other gen AI tools to find out more about these topics as you apply what you’ve learned in your Google UX Design Certificate to your work—or explore using it outside of work to continue your AI learning journey.

## **Key takeaways**

### **The growing role of AI in UX design**

# Use generative AI to work smarter and faster

In the introductory reading you learned that AI refers to computer programs that can complete cognitive tasks typically associated with human intelligence. One specific type of AI is **generative AI** (gen AI), which is AI that can generate new content, like text, images, or other media. [Gemini](http://gemini.google.com/)

, [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) by OpenAI, and [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/)

are examples of generative AI tools. You can interact with a generative AI tool by entering a **prompt**, which is input that provides instructions to an AI tool about how to generate output. The tool then creates new content based on that prompt.

In your work as a UX designer, you can leverage generative AI tools to help you complete both practical and creative tasks. Consider these applications of generative AI tools that can help you work more efficiently and effectively:

- **Create content.** You can use generative AI tools to generate text, images, and other media. For example, you might generate initial design concepts, create mockups or prototypes, or even write microcopy for your designs.
    
- **Analyze information quickly.** Generative AI tools can analyze large amounts of content quickly. For example, you might use generative AI to analyze user research findings, analyze user feedback from surveys or interviews, or even identify patterns in user behavior data.
    
- **Answer questions in detailed and nuanced ways.** Generative AI is effective at summarizing information, which makes it useful for research. For example, you can prompt a generative AI tool to provide you with information about UX design principles, accessibility guidelines, or user experience trends.
    
- **Simplify day-to-day work.** You can also use generative AI to augment routine tasks. For example, AI tools can assist with generating design documentation, creating user flows, or even suggesting color palettes and typography combinations.
    

In the upcoming series of videos you will be introduced to Paolo, a UX design professional working at Google. Paolo will introduce you to the ways that he incorporates AI into his daily workflows to do things like create user personas, improve stakeholder communications, and more.

The ways you might use generative AI in your work will likely go beyond these examples as the capabilities of AI tools expand, and as you continue your own development as a UX designer.
