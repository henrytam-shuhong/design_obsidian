   - Can be achieved symmetrically or asymmetrically for harmony.
   - *Example*: Distributing text and images evenly to create a visually pleasing composition.

2. **Contrast**:
   - Differentiates elements and draws attention to key areas.
   - Achieved using color, size, shapes, or typography.
   - *Example*: Bright buttons or call-to-actions that stand out against a muted background.

3. **Alignment**:
   - Creates a structured and organized layout by ensuring visual connections between elements.
   - *Example*: Consistently aligning text and images for a clean, professional appearance.

4. **Repetition**:
   - Reinforces consistency by reusing colors, fonts, or button styles.
   - *Example*: Maintaining the same font style across headers for coherence.

5. **Proximity**:
   - Groups related elements together to clarify relationships.
   - *Example*: Placing form labels close to their respective fields.

6. **White Space**:
   - Provides breathing room by separating design elements, reducing clutter.
