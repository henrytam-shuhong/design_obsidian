As a UX Designer, you are tasked with understanding your users, developing empathy for them, and ultimately synthesizing your research to design a product that will best address their goals, motivations, and/or frustrations.

One important step towards accomplishing this is conducting **User Interviews** or **Usability Tests** to allow your users to speak about the topic at hand with their own account/ show you what their experience with the product is like.

After you’ve conducted several (then many) interviews/ tests, how do you consolidate all of the information into precious, overarching insights?


Gollum knows what’s precious to him. How do you figure out what’s precious to you?

It’s a great organizational exercise for parsing a lot of data into high-level insights.

Creating an Affinity Diagram is accomplished by sorting data _(_facts, ideas, observations, and/ or quotes_)_ into distinct clusters by the overarching theme that defines their relationship (their _affinity_).

While it can be time-consuming and exhausting if you have a lot of data, **the value shines through being able to map out all of it and the connections between different points**. **You can better leverage your findings when you’ve got it all laid out.**

## **What it really boils down to:**

1. Creating sticky-notes/ post-its with separate facts, ideas, observations, quotes.
2. Organizing them into groups based on their relatedness (affinity) on a whiteboard in-person or online.

3. **Gather** your data (facts, observations, quotes) and read through them, highlighting which ones are **_actionable—_**meaning, what is practical and able to be acted on.
4. **Write** each of these highlighted data findings onto a separate sticky note. Using different colored sticky-notes for data corresponding to different types of data (ex: blue = quote, green = observation; or yellow = Sharon, pink = Maria) is a good way to organize your data even before diagramming. This will make finding certain notes easier.
5. **Stick** the notes onto your in-person or online whiteboard.
6. **Read** your notes out loud with your team. In your head, familiarize yourself with where certain post-its are found on the board. This will get easier as you continue to work on the diagram.
7. **Group** similar notes into groups on distinct areas of the whiteboard. They don’t have to be a perfect fit and can always be reworked as you go.
8. **Assess** whether or not certain groups can be consolidated. If so, move the notes from the groups together.
9. **Formulate** for each group a high-level insight (theme) that unifies all the notes contained within the group. Write these insights on sticky notes and stick them above their corresponding groups.

Here’s what it looks like in-person.

You have options! There’s no clear winner but here are some of my experiences with both:

**In-Person: Find a room that has a surface to stick your notes on, such as a whiteboard or a glass wall.**

Pros:

- In my experience, working in-person allowed me to digest the insights better. The pace of work was slower initially because my team communicated more about the sticky notes’ locations and contents. But because of those communications, remembering the locations of the notes and their contents became easier on a physical space than on a web interface. _My theory for this phenomenon is that navigating the online whiteboard was much faster and the constant zooming/ panning that happened online didn’t leave a constant enough impression of the whiteboard to form memories._
- Also in my experience, seeing **_all_** the notes laid out in my field of view allowed me to process the information contained within and their connections more easily.
- Having a physical space and board is more conducive to having a clear leader for the workshop, or a leader for each portion of the workshop.
- Going through the pains of creating a physical diagram leaves you with a greater feeling of satisfaction.

Cons:

- You cannot “save” the Affinity Diagram. Photos of the diagram may suffice, but they won’t look as “clean” as a digital diagram.
- More time-consuming
- Physical space around the whiteboard may feel cramped and difficult for multiple people to navigate around.
- The sticky note adhesive may prove to be rather unsticky on some surfaces.

**Online: Use a collaborative whiteboarding platform such as Miro (**[**link**](https://miro.com/)**)**

Pros:

- Its collaborative and online nature allows teams to work on the same board regardless of their team members’ locations.
- Team members can see where your mouse is/ what sections you’re working on.
- Boards are saved automatically and can be referenced at a later time.
- No difficulties stemming from multiple people navigating a (small) physical space.
- It allows you to pan and zoom in/out the whiteboard view to easily focus on certain sections of the whiteboard.

Cons:

- Although completing the Affinity Diagram online is faster than in-person, I found that I wasn’t able to process all of the data and the insights extracted as well as I could when completing the diagram in-person.
- It’s easy to lose track of where notes have been moved when multiple people are working at the same time.

**_My recommendation_**: I’m leaning towards Affinity Diagramming in-person. Although more time and energy-consuming, I found that I was able to understand the data’s connections better and communicate more with my team to sift through it all.

Try both methods for yourself and see which one you prefer.

Through your **Affinity Diagram**, you will have synthesized your prior research findings into insights you can use going forward to inform your product’s design direction.
